'ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT Mounting trade friction between the\nU.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia\'s exporting\nnations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic\ndamage, businessmen and officials said.\n    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.\nMove against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the\nU.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.\n    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt\nthem in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo\'s loss might be\ntheir gain.\n    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on\nimports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in\nretaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to stick to a pact not\nto sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.\n    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs\nat 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms\nsaid they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the\nnew taxes.\n    \"We wouldn\'t be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for\nleading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric\nIndustrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.\n    \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time\nbeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of\nexports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom\nMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James\nCapel and Co>.\n    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.\n    \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against\nJapan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior\nTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.\n    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last\nyear, 95 pct of it with the U.S.\n    The surplus helped swell Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves\nto 53 billion dlrs, among the world\'s largest.\n    \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and\ncut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we\nwant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said\nPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.\n    A senior official of South Korea\'s trade promotion\nassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan\nmight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports\nare similar to those of Japan.\n    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion\ndlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.\n    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough\ncurbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of\nsemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the\nU.S.\n    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been\nselling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics\nmanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such\na short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by\nfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.\n    \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,\ndirector-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.\n    \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will\nbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong\nis the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.\n    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong\'s biggest export market,\naccounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.\n    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade\ntalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,\nIndustry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.\n    \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two\ncountries which are major trading partners of ours is a very\nserious matter,\" Button said.\n    He said Australia\'s concerns centred on coal and beef,\nAustralia\'s two largest exports to Japan and also significant\nU.S. Exports to that country.\n    Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the\ntrade stand-off continue.\n    Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined\na package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.\n    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget\nand record public works spending in the first half of the\nfinancial year.\n    They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency\nmeasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone\'s avowed fiscal reform program.\n    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto\nKuroda, Japan\'s deputy minister of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an\neffort to end the dispute.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS The Ministry of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand\noutlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese\nenergy demand, ministry officials said.\n    MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy\nsupplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600\nmln, they said.\n    The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in\nJapanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen\nand a decline in domestic electric power demand.\n    MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand\noutlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the\nAgency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.\n    They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy\nsupply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.\n    Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan\'s electric power\nin the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27\npct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and\nliquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Thailand\'s improved business climate this\nyear resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials\nand semi-finished products.\n    The country\'s oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the\nfirst quarter due to lower oil prices.\n    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6\nbillion baht from 56.6 billion.\n    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower\nearnings from many key commodities including rice whose\nearnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26\npct and canned pineapples seven pct.\n    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up\n64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.\n REUTER\n&#3;',1

'INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is\nlikely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and\npossibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian\nNainggolan said.\n    He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in\npalm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.\n    Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil\nmay also be introduced. But he said the question was still\nbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no\ndecision on when to go ahead had been made.\n    The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber\nphysicals on an open outcry system four days a week.\n    \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said.\n\"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a\nmistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\"\n    Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee\nadded in January 1986.

Robusta coffee grades four and five are\ntraded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,\nexchange officials said.\n    The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the\nintroduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one\nofficial said a feasibility study was needed first. No\ndecisions are likely until after Indonesia\'s elections on April\n23, traders said.\n    Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the\nworld\'s second largest producer of natural rubber, should\nexpand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of\nthe exchange would help this.\n    Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost\noverseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.\n    He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to\nencourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would\nalso visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to\nencourage participation.\n    Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start\nalthough trading in coffee has been disappointing.\n    Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in\nApril 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9\nmln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered\nlocally, the latest exchange report said.\n     Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905\ntonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.\n     Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and\n44 traders.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to\nlose its status as Japan\'s most profitable bank as a result of\nits merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.\n    Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9\ntrillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank\nwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in\nOctober.\n    But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu\ntold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its\nposition.\n    \"We\'ll be back in position in first place within three\nyears,\" Komatsu said in an interview.\n    He said that while the merger will initially reduce\nSumitomo\'s profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand\nSumitomo\'s branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where\nit has been relatively weak.\n    But financial analysts are divided on whether and how\nquickly the gamble will pay off.\n    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in\nview of the smaller bank\'s large debts. Others argue the merger\nwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\nnetwork from scratch.\n    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\nexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\nand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\nwisdom of some of those moves.\n    \"They\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\nit\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\nfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.\n    Among Sumitomo\'s problems are limits placed on its move to\nenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\ninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\npct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\nleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\npersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n    \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\nFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n    \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\nwe can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\nyears, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\ninto the securities business at home.\n    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\'s\nversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\nfrom investment banking.\n    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\nsaid he hopes further deregulation will create new\nopportunities.\n    \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\ncases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\nbank related. That\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\ndomestic securities business as profitable government bond\ndealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\nLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\nthe securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\nsubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\nsecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\nfollowing a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\nuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\ndecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n    \"We don\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\nin two or three years,\" he said.\n    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\nlending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\nreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\ntime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\nmerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n    \"It\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\nKleinwort\'s Smithson.\n    \"After that, it\'s a question of absorbing and juggling\naround. It will be the next decade before we see if the\nstrategy is right or wrong.\"\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING Australian markets are booming as foreign\nfund managers redirect capital away from the United States and\nother traditional markets, analysts said.\n    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and\nan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of\nfresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and\nU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.\n    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in\nand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they\ndiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.\n    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in\nthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the\ncurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.\n    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital\nare not available, but brokers said they received almost daily\ninquiries from Japan and the United States.\n    \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about\nand they don\'t know what to do with it. Some of that is ending\nup here with the attraction of high interest rates and\nreasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd\neconomist Brian Hamley said.\n    \"There is a \'flight to quality\',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may\nnot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren\'t too\nmany other countries where you\'d want to put your money.\"\n    The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting\ninvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\nthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\n    \"We\'re looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.\nWhere some people would be concerned about the value of the\nU.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose\nsaid. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap\nand the currency looks stable?\"\n    But turning that capital into more permanent productive\ninvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.\n    \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\ndirection in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore\ninvestors would carefully watch the government\'s promised tough\neconomic statement on May 14.\n    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\ninterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\neasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were\nbadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar\nand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\n    \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be\ndelivered, if the statement wasn\'t considered tough enough, one\nmight see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said.\n    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough\neconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\nstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\n    \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think\nthey would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said.\n    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased\ninterest in investment in Australia and the need to shield\nJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\n    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an\nelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\npolicy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off\nthe yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.\n    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked\nsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar\nwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.\n    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the\nAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\ntrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\n    Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\nAustralian share market.

'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY Kuwait\'s oil-reliant and debt-ridden\neconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices\nwill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists\nsay.\n    Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold\noil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the\nnorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.\n    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross\ndomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year\nafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.\n    This was after taking into account inflation in consumer\nprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.\n    Factors depressing economic activity include the\n6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\'s doorstep, which\nthreatens the emirate\'s vital oil export lifeline through the\nGulf and has sapped business confidence.\n    But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September\nwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis\ncaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive\nnew debt settlement program was introduced.\n    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward\ntrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.\n    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer\nspending, thus generating an informal credit system.\n    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are\nstill owed by individuals and companies.\n    There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)\nin outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which\none-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as\nbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it\nwill not allow any banks to go under.\n    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\nproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\ndebtors have regular cash flows or not.\n    Banks\' shareholders and depositors will have their rights\nguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\nin a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\nis the biggest after oil.\n    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride\nout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\n    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\ncompared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\nyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.\n    But strategic diversification into downstream operations in\nEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\nhome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\nover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\n    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average\n2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\nproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\ncrude.\n    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\nfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic\ninflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent\nyears and signs government spending on productive sectors will\nremain steady.\n    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8\nbillion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below\nthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit\nGulf.\n    Kuwait\'s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put\nofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income\nof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.\n    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these\nreserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for\nthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.\n    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,\nrevenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,\ndoubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.\n    This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded\nin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at\nup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some\nshortfall.\n    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for\neconomic growth this year or next.\n    \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is\nimportant.\"\n    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday\nthe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state\nspending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the\neconomy.\n    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be\nspelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

His petition said UCPB\'s\nplans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of\nfiduciary duties.\"\n    The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be\nheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a\ngovernment nominee on the company\'s board.\n    De los Angeles, who represents SMC\'s minority stockholders,\nasked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by\nthe company\'s board.\n    On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the\nsequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per\nshare. De los Angeles told the SEC the company\'s retained\nearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the\npurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of\ndividends.\n    De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate\nan SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt\nto equity ratio. He quoted SMC\'s chief financial director Ramon\ndel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would\nboost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.\n    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier\nsuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres\nSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.\n    De los Angeles\' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming\nlast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC\'s Hong Kong\nsubsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.\nThe loan assumption was again ratified by last week\'s board\nmeeting.\n    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to\nresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by\nApril 15.\n    \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of\na continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard\nof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early\ndisposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in\na statement.\n    \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have\nreached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of\npayment, this suit is in direct contravention of the\ngovernment\'s expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement\nof the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added.\n    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on\nCojuangco\'s court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from\nus might be interpreted as adversarial.\"\n    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which\nsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible\nto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United\nStates citizen.\n    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares,\nwhich can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which\nare available to foreign buyers.\n    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among\nprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by\nthe &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed\ninstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers\nin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.\n    The sale was aborted when Diaz\'s Presidential Commission on\nGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were\nowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President\nFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the\nU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend\nannounced last June.\n    \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz\ntold Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\"\n    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy\nwould be resolved before the company\'s annual stockholders\'\nmeeting, scheduled for May 14.\n    San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion\npesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in\n1985.

'ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.\ndollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will\npropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record\nprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,\nmajor company executives predicted.\n    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an\nindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF\nCorp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms\nto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.\n    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the\nKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for\nmoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.\n    \"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\" said\nPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,\n\"There\'s no major plant capacity being added around the world\nnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\nthe old ones.\"\n    Analysts say the chemical industry\'s biggest customers,\nautomobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\npaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\n    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\n90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\nproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\nmanaging director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\nfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\nby as much as 300 pct, he said.\n    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\nHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\nlast year and predicted it would have the best year in its\nhistory.\n    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\nand chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\ndollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire\nchemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"\nOreffice said.\n    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\nindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\nLast year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\ndlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\n    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\nindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\nplanning, said Pace\'s John Dosher.\n    Dosher said last year\'s fall in oil prices made feedstocks\ndramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\nwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\nU.S. chemical exports.\n    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\nbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\nmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\nin the early 1980s.\n    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\nhave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\nto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\nunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\nfriendly and hostile takeover attempts.\n    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\nUnion Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\nfor Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\nand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> \nhas divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\nbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\n    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\nheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\nthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\nethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\nare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\n    \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the\npast two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\nchemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\ndeteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually\nkill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\nmarket.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\n    \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\ncarried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF\'s Heyman\ncautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\nill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"\n    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\nSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\nmln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\n    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\nof Dupont\'s Conoco Inc\'s chemical business, has spent 1.1\nbillion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\nalong the Texas Gulf Coast.\n    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\nare the building blocks of specialty products.\n    \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\nglamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand\nis expected to grow by about three pct annually.\n    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\nchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\nplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\nand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical\nbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided the\nU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do\nSul had between them 70 pct of the nation\'s capacity, but were\nresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.\n    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West\ngrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage\ncapacity.\n    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and\nmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation\'s grains\nproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.\n    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,\nthere is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to\nstoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for\nstoring loose grain, Brito said.\n    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the\ncrops.\n    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop\nhas been evident from television reports, which have shown\nenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.\n Reuter\n&#3;',1

Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for\nMontreal-based Dominion called the report just \"rumors.\"\n    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.\n    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of\nthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if\nBurlington actually came into play.\n    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,\nadded credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it\nwas looking for a takeover in the U.S.\n    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills\nand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for\na U.S. acquisition.\n    A Dominion spokesman said Canada\'s largest textile producer\nhas been negotiating with \"many\" U.S. textile companies, but\nwould not say whether Burlington was among them.\n    \"There have been acquisitions in this area. It\'s not\nunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the\nhousecleaning they\'ve done,\" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson\nMcKinnon.\n    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets\nand other linens, to J.P.

It also has reorganized management, and focused its\noperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign\ncompetition, Gormley said.\n    \"They\'ve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,\"\nsaid Gormley.

'HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped\nto maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to\nthe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite\ncontinuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts\nto extend world penetration.\n    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln\nguilders, after 265 mln in 1985.\n    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe\'s\nleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,\nsaid sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.\n    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,\nWhere the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,\nwhere sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.\n    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker\nforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.\n    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the\nincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila\nS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly\nin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The\ncompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\nrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n    Heineken\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profit\nnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\nalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\nEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\ninto the closed West German market -- Europe\'s biggest beer\nmarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\nhave the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\npoint,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\nhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n    \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\nmarket, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\nwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\ntaste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\nregionalized.\n     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\nAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\nimportant beer growth markets in the long term.\n     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\nmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\nhampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\nper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\nand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n1986 sales.\n    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\nof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\nhave been looking at other possibilities.\n    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\nthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\nhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\nmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\npopular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\npossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n    Chairman Heineken said the company\'s seven year efforts to\npenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\ncontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\'s\nmarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that\nare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western\nmoney.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY UAL Inc may have a response this\nafternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United\nAirlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.\n    \"Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we\nneed to get a clarification out,\" the spokesman said, adding\nthat there was a \"50-50\" chance a statement would be released\ntoday.\n    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for\n2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.\n    Takeover speculation has driven UAL\'s stock for several\nweeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer\nDonald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also\nheld discussions with its chairman.\n    The developer indicated in those talks that he took the\nposition as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.\n    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying\nUAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2\nmln shares.\n    \"United has got to consider this proposal. I think the\npilot\'s proposal is realistic. I don\'t exptect them to take it,\nbut it could put some interesting options in front of UAL\nmanagement,\" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.\n    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack\nwhen it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz\nrental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a\nstrategy to become a travel service company.\n    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union\nconcerned that the company was not focussing enough attention\non its airline.\n    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its\nnew focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.\n    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has\nbeen busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100\ndlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as\nwidespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe\nthe stock is in play.\n    Market sources have said that although Trump attracted\nattention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a\ncatalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps\nthrowing the company into the hands of another buyer.\n    \"The first domino is you have an investor with a\nconsiderable stake. the second domino is the union. That type\nof attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,\"\nsaid Pettee.\n    \"What\'s interesting is the values are there. There\'s\nsomething for everybody,\" he said.\n\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT Financial analysts say they are\npleased with congressional moves to trim next year\'s federal\nbudget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help\nimprove the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.\n    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow\nto approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming\nfiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.\n    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan\nthat would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next\nyear.\n        \"In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is\ninfinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little\nimpact on the economy and the trade deficit,\" said Stanley\nCollander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.\n    \"At best, it will have a small positive effect,\" Collander\nsaid in an interview.\n    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly\ntold Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way\nto help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease\nsome of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.\n    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade\nimbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker\nhas warned that a further fall in the dollar\'s value is fraught\nwith danger.\n    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\nimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\ncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\n    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\nmajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\nthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\nshould be stabilized at around current levels.\n    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\ntake steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\nagreed to cut its budget deficit.\n    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\nway to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\nto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\n    \"If you don\'t deal with the budget deficit, everything else\nyou do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent\ntestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\ngovernment\'s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\nsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\nto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\nStates.\n    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\ncurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\n    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\nthat any deficit reduction was better than none.\n    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \nnot enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\nneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\nfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.\n    \"There\'s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\nyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\nFed\'s flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\nis, it\'s not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.\n    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government\'s\nmost vexing and persistent problems.\n    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\nlittle indication that this year\'s figure will be any lower,\nthough administration officials have predicted it will drop by\nabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year\'s end.\n    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\nworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\nfederal budget.\n    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\nattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\nthe 1986-1991 period by last year\'s Gramm-Rudman balanced\nbudget law.\n    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\nnext year\'s federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\nCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\nshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\n    \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\nmost you\'re going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,\nsaid Touche Ross\'s Collander. \"To do something more than that\nwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"\n    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\nshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\n    \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\nreduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now\nlook like a failure to Wall Street.\"\n    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\nlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\nbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\ndefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\nanticipated spending levels for next year.\n    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of\nnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new \ntaxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

They said they were looking for an acquisition. It\ndoesn\'t surprise me that they came up with another one,\" said\nAllan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.\n    American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion\ndlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to\nbuy the company.

'BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler\ncalled on central banks of major industrialised nations to\ncooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.\n    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released\nhere, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was\nprotectionism and control on capital movements.\n    \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market\ntransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have\nthem,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would\nhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\nto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\n    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\nhad parted company with transactions in goods, services and\ninvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\ndetermined market trends.\n    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\ngrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\nwould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\n    \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\ndifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\nthose needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\nmounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\n    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\nCurrent account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\ngoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.\n    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\nrise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\nof European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\nto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\nmake itself felt compared with the price effect.\n    \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\nfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current account\nover the medium term,\" Koehler said.\n    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\nonly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\nIn Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\nrise faster than GNP.\n    \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\n    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\nprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\nan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\n    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\ndifferential would Europe and Japan look for financial\ninvestment in the U.S.\n    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\nhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\nmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\n    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\nby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\ninterest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\nand its substantial impact on exchange rates.\n    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\nprice stability, economic growth and full employment but also\nto tackle international problems like the exchange rate\nproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\n    A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\nof non-inflationary economic growth in an international\nmonetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\n    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\nnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\nto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\nthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,\nbecause they were only testing points for the market, he said.\n    In order to keep the international monetary system free of\ndisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\nalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY Japan\'s little-known Ministry of Posts and\nTelecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force\nto be reckoned with, political analysts said.\n    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.\nAnd Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of\na lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,\nthey said.\n    \"The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of\na key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,\"\nsaid one diplomatic source.\n    \"They are a potent political force,\" the diplomatic source\nsaid.\n    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not\nalways help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts\nsaid.\n    \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not\nso internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru\nUchida. \"Suddenly they\'re standing at the centre of the world\ncommunity and in that sense, they\'re at a loss (as to) how to\nface the situation.\"\n    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with\nLondon over efforts by Britain\'s Cable and Wireless Plc to keep\na major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in\nJapan\'s lucrative overseas telephone business.\n    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival\ngroups, arguing the market cannot support more than one\ncompetitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now\nmonopolizes the business.\n    It has also opposed a major management role in the planned\nmerger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on\nthe grounds that no such international precedent exists.\n    The ministry\'s stance has outraged both London, which has\nthreatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger\nplan is evidence of Japan\'s failure to honour pledges to open\nits telecommunications market.\n    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it\nsays have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan\'s car\ntelephone and satellite communications market.\n    Much of MPT\'s new prominence stems from the growth of the\nsector it regulates.\n    \"What has been happening is an important shift in the\neconomy which makes the ministry a very important place,\" said\nJames Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory\nService Inc.\n    A decision to open the telecommunications industry to\ncompetition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted\nrather than lessened MPT\'s authority, analysts said.\n    \"With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto\nlegal framework,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell\nWhitten.\n    Close links with the powerful political faction of the\nruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime\nMinister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT\'s influence, the\nanalysts said.\n    \"Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka\nfaction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance\nof MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of\nthe influential political group, he added.\n    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to\nthe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the\nPostal Savings System, analysts said.\n    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate\ninterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial\nliberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal\nSavings System\'s ability to offer slightly higher rates than\nbanks, they said.\n    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT\'s\nobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized\nthe ministry as feudal.\n    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting\ncompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under its\nwing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest\nprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.\n    But many of the ministry\'s actions are not unlike those of\nits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world\nincluding Britain, several analysts said.\n    \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said.\n\"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order\nin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable\nview,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE European currency markets reacted quietly\nto the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers\nranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to\nsurprise that the markets should have expected so much.\n    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies\nand traded in a narrow range after the communique, which\nreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency\nstabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.\n    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining\nbroadly entrenched in its current trading range.\n    \"The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84\nmarks,\" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank\nAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\n    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\nwith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\nMerchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\n    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\nin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\nthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\npossibly to 140 yen.\n    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann\'s view, saying he expects\na dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\n    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\nunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\nsentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\noperators to test the downside.\n    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\nWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\ncurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\nworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\nnear term, the traders said.\n    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\ncommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar\'s\ndownward trend.\n    Traders in several centres said the market would look for\nfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\ndefend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly\nconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\nintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"\n    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\n\"They\'re going to put somebody\'s resolve to the test soon.\" The\nU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\n    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\nunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\nEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825\nmarks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.\n    Chase Bank\'s Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said\nthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable\nmarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme\nvolatility seen in the first few months of this year.\n    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the\ncommunique made clear the leading nations did not want a\nfurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.\n    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to\n1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre\naccord\'s supposed currency target range.\n    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were\nready for a period of \"mainly sideways movement.\"\n    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique\ncontributing to greater stability.\n    \"Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big\nboost,\" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he\nexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks\nin the next three months.\n    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said\nthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations and\nshould not have produced disappointment.\n    \"The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade\npolicies to redress current imbalances are of a different\ntimescale than currency markets operate on,\" the source told\nReuters, \"This is a political process which takes time.\"\n    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in\nBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on\ncurrency markets today. \"Did people really expect a patent\nremedy?\" he asked.\n    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday\'s meeting was only\nthe first in a series and said the market would watch carefully\nin the next few weeks for any changes in positions.\n    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was\nnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by\nJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could\nlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.\n    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in\npushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months\nwhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to\nsupport the Paris accord.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

They agreed, however, that further actions will\nbe essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain\nglobal economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.\"\n    It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan\'s ruling\nLiberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the\ncommunique termed \"extraordinary and urgent measures\" including\nan \"unprecedented front-end loading of public works\nexpenditures.\"\n    The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought\ntogether ministers and central bank governors of the seven\nmajor industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West\nGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.\n    The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment\non cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris\nwhen they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the\nthen-current levels.\n    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall\nagainst the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by\nthe Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at\naround postwar lows.\n    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United\nStates and European countries for its only modest efforts to\nopen its markets to outside competition and to reduce its\nexports.\n    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open\ndomestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not\nelaborate.\n    It said the officials \"reaffirmed the view that around\ncurrent levels their currencies are within ranges broadly\nconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\nintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
'AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>\nreported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln\nguilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits\nfor 1987.\n    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion\nguilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its\nrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a\nchange in accounting practice. It added that revenues would\nhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.\n    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly\ndue to its life insurance business.\n    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose\ndespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and\nhigher personal risks.\n    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage\ninsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.\n    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and\nlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change\nin accounting for U.S. Annuities.\n    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal\ninvestment influences that it should be accounted differently\nfrom the more traditional insurances.\n    This change in accounting practice and another change to\naccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,\nresulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln\nguilders.\n    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits\nwere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial\ncosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The\nHague.\n    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged\nin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial\ncosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.\n    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in\nMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these\ncosts and made only a small contribution to the group\'s\nprofits.\n    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill\nfor Monumental Corp.\n    AEGON\'s net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December\n1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.\n  REUTER\n&#3;',0

'G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi\nMiyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed\ntheir Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the\nmarket of their resolve.\n    At a news conference after today\'s G-7 meeting, Miyazawa\nsaid the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a\ntotally new statement was needed.\n    The speculative selling did not reflect economic\nfundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a\nreaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he\nsaid.\n    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had\nconcentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the\nmark, had remained stable.\n    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the\nParis accord was not worth being called fundamental.\n    \"As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression\nof \'current level\' is rather vague idea,\" he said.\n    The yen\'s movement in the past several weeks is within the\nrange agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.\n    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing\na level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,\nMiyazawa said.\n    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the\nstatement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven\nbecause the yen appreciated against the dollar while other\nmajor currencies largely have been stable.\n    He also said Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party has\njusted adoped a package to reflate the economy while other\nnations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short\nperiod since the Paris agreement.\n    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese\nsemiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7\nmeeting and did not affect the currency talks.\n    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing\ncountries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative\noutlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0
'YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE The yen is likely to start another\nuneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies\nbecause the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new,\ncurrency and bond analysts here said.\n    \"Is that it? I was expecting something more than that,\" said\none trader at a major Wall Street securities company.\n    Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: \"The\nmarket now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again.\"\n    The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days\njust before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying\nbearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday\'s meeting\nof the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven\nindustrialized nations in Washington.\n    After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a\ncommunique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement\'s\nview that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent\nwith economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability\nshould be fostered around these levels.\n    The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.\n    \"They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with\nfundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it\'s in line\nwhen it\'s at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?,\" asked\nRepublic\'s Cohen.\n    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled\nspeculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are\nprepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is\nstill inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.\n    Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the\nkey psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the\nauthorities\' permissible range.\n    Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar\'s decline would\nprobably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop\nup the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market\nintervention and public comments.\n    Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of\nJapan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of\ndollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.\n    The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively\nselling dollars for yen before Tuesday\'s February U.S. Trade\ndata. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion\ndlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.\n\n\n\n\n&#3;',0

She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\n    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\nwith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\nMerchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\n    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\nin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\nthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\npossibly to 140 yen.\n    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann\'s view, saying he expects\na dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\n    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\nunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\nsentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\noperators to test the downside.\n    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\nWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\ncurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\nworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\nlong term, the traders said.\n    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\ncommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar\'s\ndownward trend.\n    Traders in several centres said the market would look for\nfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\ndefend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly\nconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\nintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"\n    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\n\"They\'re going to put somebody\'s resolve to the test soon.\" The\nU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\n    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\nunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\nEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825\nmarks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.\n    Chase Bank\'s Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said\nthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable\nmarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme\nvolatility seen in the first few months of this year.\n    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the\ncommunique made clear the leading nations did not want a\nfurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.\n    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to\n1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre\naccord\'s supposed currency target range.\n    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were\nready for a period of \"mainly sideways movement.\"\n    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique\ncontributing to greater stability.\n    \"Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big\nboost,\" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he\nexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks\nin the next three months.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS The United States, which has long\nsought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be\nsatisfied Tokyo\'s latest package is a major development and\nallows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement\nto stabilize currencies.\n    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker considered Tokyo\'s package, announced\nyesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.\n    But yesterday\'s statement by seven leading industrial\npowers endorses the yen\'s rise from around 153 to the dollar,\nthe level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.\n    And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far\nEast demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that\ncurrencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the\ncountries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point\ndespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.\n    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan\'s Finance Minister, said the\nmovement since Paris was consistent with currency trading\nranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\n    \"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past\nseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the\ndiscussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday.\n    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was\nannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of\nMiyazawa\'s departure for Washington, to attend yesterday\'s\nmeetings of leading industrial nations.\n    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\n\"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris\nAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges\nbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.\n    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West\nGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore\nrepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to\nfoster exchange rate stability.\n    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central\nbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the\ndollar\'s fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\nintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\nyears. Monetary sources also said they understood that\nSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely\nsuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.\n    They also said there was a growing feeling among the\nfinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\nmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\ndifferences in past meetings.\n    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\nthe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\nyesterday\'s statement to have won acceptance from other\ncountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\n    Bonn\'s finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\nmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\nbetween West Germany and Japan\'s trade surpluses and America\'s\ntrade deficit have already taken place.\n    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\nthe budget deficit even though it is implied in the\nreafffirmation of Paris.\n    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\nessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\nreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\n    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\nweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\nsharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose\nsubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\nundermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.\n    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\npolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\n    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\nwelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\ncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\n    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\ndollar blunts Tokyo\'s export drive to the United States, the\nJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\n    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\ntheir policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\nFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\n    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\nto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\n    The United States and France, backed by the International\nMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a\nlimited number of economic objectives such as growth,\ninflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\naccount balances.\n    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\nconsultations between the countries on whether corrective\naction should be required.\n    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\nhas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\nimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\n    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\nsounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\ncurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\n    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\nof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\nrelatively free currency markets of recent years.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS The global economy is expected to\nweaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious\npoverty outlook, economic analysts said.\n    For finance ministers and central bankers attending this\nweek\'s semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund\nand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an\nadditional concern.\n    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct\nthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.\n    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a\nmeasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to\n2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.\n    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,\nanother measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0\npct from 3.5 pct last year.\n    The new figures are considered a major disappointment to\nthe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the\nindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil\nprices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope\nwith growing mounds of debt.\n    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed\nthe industrial country economies would move up to an annual\ngrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.\n    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some\ntime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into\nan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.\n    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier\nstates for markets for their products as well as financial\nassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations\' \neconomies poses fundamental worries.\n    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have\nonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,\nincluding the key one of exports.\n    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,\nhas served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it\ntoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only\n2.3 pct, according to the IMF.\n    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the\nUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to\nignite their economies but with little apparent success.\n    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and\nthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade\ndeficit.\n    Reagan administration officials have been saying that the\nimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much\nslower than expected.\n    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has\nto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to\nwork through to payments flows -- probably at least three years\nto get a resonably complete effect.\"\n    The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even\nmore time on this occasion.\"\nREUTER^M\n&#3;',0
'SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES The head of Spain\'s employers\'\nfederation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried\nabout the government\'s monetary policies because high real\ninterest rates were hampering investment.\n    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this\nyear were not endangering the government\'s five pct inflation\ntarget. The government\'s perceived need to control inflation by\nkeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.\n    High real interest rates were attracting an influx of\nspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting the\ngovernment\'s target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.\n    Spain\'s most closely-watched measure of money supply,\nliquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17\npct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a\ntarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.\n    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money\nrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from\n11.8 at end-1986.\n    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government\'s call to\nhold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,\nwith increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new\nwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.\n    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish\nworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.\n    He said Spain\'s current wave of strikes mainly affected the\nstate sector, where the government is trying to impose its five\npct wage ceiling.\n    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in\nSpain\'s foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first\ntwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct\nincrease over the corresponding period last year.\n    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the\npeseta to correct the imbalance.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS Lead prices have risen this week against\na background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders\nsaid.\n    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying\nor if labour problems develop in North America, they added.\n    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at\na time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and\nprices tending to drift lower.\n    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low\nlevel of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical\ndemand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.\n    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be\nfelt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,\nstocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders\nsaid.\n    The lower supply levels result from a number of different\nfactors around the globe.\n    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries\nbecause of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish\nexports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz\'s smelter at\nLinares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant\nadditional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have\nbeen drawing on LME stocks.\n    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters\' Port Pirie,\nSouth Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks\nfor maintenance. Although the company said it would meet\ncommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.\n    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes\nper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks\nand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\nU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\na regular supplier to the world market.\n    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\nhave been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\n    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\nquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\nin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\nfirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\norder was filled by merchants in March.\n    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\nthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\nestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\ndelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\nGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\na target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\n    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\nand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\nand this is believed to be in strong hands.\n    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\nlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\nwhich are not popular with merchants putting together\nshipments.\n    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\nthe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\nsecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\naffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\nthe transport of used batteries.\n    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\npart in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\nexpiring end-April at Cominco\'s Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\nMine/smelter and at Doe Run\'s Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\n    Noranda\'s New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\nexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\nstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\n    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\nspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\nfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\nto 20 from four.

'LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES Nigel Lawson, Britain\'s Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest\nrates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.\n    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven\ncountries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said\ncentral banks would continue to intervene \"as and when\nnecessary.\"\n    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more\nto stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by\nJapanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.\n    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a\nsimultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West\nGermany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget\nspeech to the British Parliament.\n    \"If anything I\'m a little bit less concerned, but there is\nstill a risk,\" he said.\n    Asked if the United States should consider increasing\ninterest rates to support the dollar, he said, \"If there is a\nneed for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn\'t need to\nbe a rise in interest rates in the United States.\"\n    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday\'s\nmeetings at the slow progress the United States had made in\nreducing its budget deficit.\n    \"We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in\nreducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it\ncontinue year after year,\" Lawson said.\n    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to\nstabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six\nweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against\nthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention.\n    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in\nthe Louvre accord, he said, \"I don\'t think so. If there had been\nno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\"\n    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson\nsaid, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode\n... but one has to be vigilant.\"\n    He said yesterday\'s G-7 statement, which affirmed that\n\"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been\n\"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean the\nsame thing,\" he said.\n    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese\nmeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of\nweakness for that agreement.\n    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa\'s\npresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate\ndomestic demand.\n    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate\nincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the package\nalso involved a second stage to increase expenditures during\nthe second half of this year.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

April futures traded this\nmorning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB\'s\naverage price of 104 stg.\n    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is\na two-tier market for physical potatoes.

But lesser\nquality grades have traded below 100 stg.\n    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered\nagainst the April futures contract between now and the end of\nthe month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.\n    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management\ncommittee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice\nand he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES Steel stocks, which have had a healthy\nrunup recently, still present some short term investment\nopportunities, according to some steel analysts.\n    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm\nprices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end\nsoon. They recommend taking profits.\n    \"It\'s that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\" said\nCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"Orders will be\nstrong for about two months, and there are signs that some\n(order rates) are starting to dive already.\"\n    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees\nsome short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp\n&lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel\nIndustries Inc &lt;IAD>.\n    \"There is still some attractiveness to steels over the\nshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and\nrising prices,\" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,\nhowever, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to\nmake them more efficient.\n    Despite his bearishness, Merrill\'s Bradford continues to\nrecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.\n    Armco\'s steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance\nsheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business\nhas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford\nnoted. \"It\'s not a high-quality investment situation yet but\nthey\'ve come a long way,\" he said.\n    \"We think the stock will do moderately better than the\nmarket,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,\ncould go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.\n    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,\nbefore special gains from recouped investment tax credits,\nagainst losses last year.\n    Armco\'s 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he\nsaid.\n    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy\non it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have\nit,\" he said.\n    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a\nshare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and\nfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot\ndepends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX\'s sales\ncome from oil and natural gas.\n    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of\nSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company\'s done a lot\n(of restructuring), more than the market\'s given them credit\nfor,\" she said.\n    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was\ntrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a\nshare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in\n1986.\n    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has\nbeen recommending the stocks since last November.\n    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group\nalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through the\nthird quarter.\n    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel)\nprices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\"\nhe said.\n    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal\ndropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives than\nnegatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic\nindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should\ncause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

Sales for all of 1987 are expected\nto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986\'s rise.\n     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket\nitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many\nanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the\nholiday nears.\n    \"Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a\ncontinuing strength in the housing market,\" said Edward\nBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an\noverall sales gain of 4.2 pct.

'HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE The House Armed Services Committee\nhas voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled\nmaterials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.\n    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and\nquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.\n    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill\nwhich will be voted on in the House next month.\n    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee\nyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage\nsell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a\nstaff member of the committee told Reuters.\n    \"They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being\nmanaged properly,\" said the staffer. \"Management of the stockpile\nover the last 10 years has been atrocious.\"\n    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a\nWhite House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n    The staffer said that under the measures passed by the\ncommittee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence\nover decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.\n    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs\nworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The\nstockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.\n    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage\nthe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.\n    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget\nand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.\n    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile\nmanagement was counter-productive, he said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
