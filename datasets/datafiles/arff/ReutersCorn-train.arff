'BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in\nthe Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early\nJanuary and improving prospects for the coming temporao,\nalthough normal humidity levels have not been restored,\nComissaria Smith said in its weekly review.\n    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.\n    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags\nof 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93\nmln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems\nthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the\narrivals figures.\n    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how\nmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has\npractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates\naround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there\nare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,\nmiddlemen, exporters and processors.\n    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit\nfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in\nobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.\n    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have\nsold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.\n    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350\ncruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.\n    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and\nonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to\n1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.\n    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with\nJune/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs\nunder New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs\nper tonne FOB.\n    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at\n4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.\n    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July\nat 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at\n2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and\n2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.\n    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,\nUruguay and open ports.\n    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for\nMarch/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times\nNew York Dec for Oct/Dec.\n    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible\ncurrency areas.\n    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325\nand 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New\nYork July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York\nSept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith\nsaid.\n    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags\nagainst the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88\ncrop.\n    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to\nbe published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after\ncarnival which ends midday on February 27.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS U.S. bank discount window borrowings\nless extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to\nWednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.\n    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131\nmln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs\nat 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week\nstatement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451\nmln dlrs.\n    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February\n25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of\n644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.\n    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that\nthere were no large single day net misses in the Fed\'s reserve\nprojections in the week to Wednesday.\n    He said that natural float had been \"acting a bit\nstrangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had been\npoor weather during the latest week.\n    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500\nmln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to\nnearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.\n    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday\'s high\nfloat, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday\'s\nfloat figure was due to holdover and transportation float at\ntwo widely separated Fed districts.\n    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of\nadjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative\n750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for\nunrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the\ncountry.\n    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two\ndifferent clearing banks had system problems and the securities\nand Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or\n2100 EST on both days.\n    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during\nboth afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve\nimpact.\n    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount\nwindow borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct\nby the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional\ninstitutions.\n    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by\nthe money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and\n15 pct by the smallest banks.\n    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess\nreserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on\nFriday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average\ndeficit for the week as a whole.\n    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high\nexcess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at\nthe smallest banks.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
'AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF American Express Co remained silent on\nmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson\nLehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be\nconsidering such a move because it is unhappy with the market\nvalue of its stock.\n    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the\nmarket calculated a partially public Shearson may command a\ngood market value, thereby boosting the total value of American\nExpress. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial\nservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.\n    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at\n72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.\n    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its\nstock activity.\n    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts\'\nmeeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement\nyesterday of management changes.\n    At the meeting, company officials said American Express\nstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance\nof Shearson, according to analysts.\n    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief\noperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of\npresident, which had been vacant. It also created four new\npositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.\n    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most\nsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total\nspinoff.\n    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of\nShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for\nAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last\nyear.\n    \"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is\ngoing to sell shearson,\" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.\nHe questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very\nprofitable securities firm.\"\n    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of\ncash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong\nasset.\n    But others believe the company could very well of\nconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one\nrumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.\n    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he\nbelieves American Express could have considered a partial\nspinoff in the past.\n    \"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a\nbig premium in the market place. Shearson\'s book value is in\nthe 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would\nprobably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market\ncapitalization,\" said Eckenfelder.\n    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since\nit plans to expand globally.\n    \"They have enormous internal growth plans that takes\ncapital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to\nenhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the\nroad,\" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.\n    \"They\'ve outlined the fact that they\'re investing heavily\nin the future, which goes heavily into the international\narena,\" said Lewis. \"...That does not preclude acquisitions and\ndivestitures along the way,\" he said.\n    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the\nbrokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might\nbetter reflect other assets, such as the travel related\nservices business.\n    \"It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure\nto brokerage. The value of the other components could command a\nhigher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of\nthe total operating earnings of the company,\" he said.\n     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax\noperating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;',0

However, if it is determined that\ncertificates have caused the government grain stockpile to\ndecrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.\n    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates\nprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.\n    But a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire\nagainst certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase\nin the certificate program,\" an agricultural consultant said.\n    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,\nwhile USDA remains firmly committed to it.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987 Liquefied natural gas imports from\nAlgeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its\neconomically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.\n    Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian\nstate petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in\nAlgiers that such imports would be made this year.\n    \"Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and\nthe time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay\nthe import until 1988/1989,\" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas\nanalyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.\n    Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former\ncustomers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary\nof Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials\ntold Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington\nNorthern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.\n    Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were\nfeasible. \"On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have\nmade capital investment to handle LNG import can operate\nprofitably even in the current price environment,\"  Frank\nSpadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.\n   Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports\non U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend\nhigher by the end of 1987.\n    A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of\nMexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm\nprices, Shearson\'s Tulis said.\n   In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of\nsupplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.\n    Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,\nsaying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.\n    Company sources also said that any negotiations with\nAlgeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate\nvolumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market\nvalues.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
'SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS Switzerland\'s economy, combining low\nunemployment, financial stability and a large external payments\nsurplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory\nfuture, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment, OECD, said.\n    This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight\nfiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it\nsaid.\n    The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out\nsome signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in\ninflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.\n    The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product\ngrowth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986\nand a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after\nlast year\'s sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.\n    But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest\nincrease in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate\nunchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial\nnation OECD area.\n    Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to\nthe dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,\nthe report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct\nrise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct\nrespectively in 1986.\n    The faster growth of imports compared with exports this\nyear and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant\nthat the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP\nwould shrink in both years.\n    But \"given Switzerland\'s large external surplus, there\nshould be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than\nGDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to\nimproving international balances,\" the OECD said.\n    Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually\nbuoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several\nyears of relative weakness, it noted.\n    In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat\nto a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall\nGDP, it added.\n    The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained\nbright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels\nlast year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation\nin both the industry and service sectors, it said.\n    As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment\ninvestment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year\nafter vigorous growth in 1986.\n    But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for\ntourism and the banking industry, two major service sector\nearners of foreign exchange.\n    The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the\naccelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could\nlead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.\n    Particularly for the banks, \"recent developments in\ninternational financial markets give rise to the question\nwhether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial\nflexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed\nrequired ... To preserve its competitive position,\" it said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

One USDA official who took part in the\nconsultations this week described them as an exchange of \"calm,\nbasic, factual economics.\"\n    Another USDA official said there was \"not even an informal\nsuggestion or hint\" that the Soviets would live up to their\npledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were\ngranted more favorable terms.\n    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an\nEEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be\ndelayed because of disarray within the White House stemming\nfrom the Iran arms affair.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios\nseen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has\npushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean\nprocessing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean\nmeal and oil.\n    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the\nNational Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78\nmln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over\nthe past two months when crush margins surged to the best\nlevels seen in over a year.\n    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed\nsoybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the\nweekly crush number.\n    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,\nwith most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge\nin shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next\nfew months.\n    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed\ndemand is very light for this time of year due to the milder\nthan normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in\nan attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.\n    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent\nweeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the\nnearby March contract today.\n    \"Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold\nMay, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,\nwhich would cause March to gain on deferreds),\" one CBT crush\ntrader said.\n    \"But they\'ve been bailing out this week because the March\nhas been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not\ntomorrow, then later in the month,\" he added.\n    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush\nratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)\nfell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per\nbushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two\ndays.\n    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no\nprocessors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable\nlevel, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut\nback production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.\n    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid\npremiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.\n    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents\nfor every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down\nsharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below\nthe average cost of production, cash dealers said.\n    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with\nlittle talk of taking temporary down-time, so far.

'FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that\nthe central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of\npressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making\nmeeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.\n    \"The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we\ncan take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had\nchanged,\" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.\n    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee\nlast Thursday that the Fed\'s policy \"has been unchanged up to\ntoday.\"\n    Although Volcker\'s statement last Thursday allayed most\nfears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on\nreserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted\nconfirmation of a steady policy in today\'s data, which covered\nthe two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.\n    This need for additional reassurance was made all the more\nacute by the Fed\'s decision yesterday to drain reserves from\nthe banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase\nagreements for the first time since April of last year,\neconomists added.\n    Today\'s data showed that the draining action was for a\nfairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.\n    \"The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively\nsizeable matched sales on Wednesday,\" said Dana Johnson of\nFirst National Bank of Chicago. \"But there was a clearly\njustified need for them.

'FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES France\'s right wing government is facing\ngrowing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising\ndown its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation\nforecasts for this year.\n    Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector\nforecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation\nestimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its\neconomic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a\n2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last\nseptember.\n    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures\nwould not push the government off its chosen mix of price\nderegulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.\n    But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would\npush to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising\nthe spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.\n    And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed\nPrime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth\nand rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,\nperhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential\nelections due by April 1988.\n    \"The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\"\nsaid Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. \"We have the\nimpression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth\nthis year.\"\n    \"The big question is whether the government\'s policy of wage\nmoderation will be maintained,\" he added.\n    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout\n1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises\njustified by increased productivity.\n    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond\nMaire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already\nrejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built\ninto future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher\nprices.\n    Calling the government\'s policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" he\nalso demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He\nannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the\ngovernment would spend two billion francs on a series of\nmeasures to boost employment and training\n    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate\nForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac\nearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of\nFrance\'s unions, declared the defence of its members earnings\nits top priority.\n    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and\nstill rising, government supporters and some economic analysts\nsaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.\n    \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist\ngovernment and I dont think this administration is going to\nreverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist at\nrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.\n    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas\nand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher\ninflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he\nsaid.\n    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more\nthan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7\nper cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.\n    \"But that would still be an exceptional achievement\nconsidering that for the first time since the Second World War\nall french prices have been freed,\" he commented.\n    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments\nabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible\nfor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living\ncosts.\n    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should\nhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.\n    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long\nas the government kept wages under control.\n    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of\n1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more\nthan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,\nINSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,\nhe added.\n    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to\nhelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget\ndeficit, several analysts said.\n    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value\nAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a\nloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than\nexpected growth, they said.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;',0

It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct\nin 1984.\n    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible\nfor the slump.\n REUTER\n&#3;',1

'INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE Indonesia appears to be nearing a\npolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected\neconomy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.\n    To counter falling oil revenues, the government has\nlaunched a series of measures over the past nine months to\nboost exports outside the oil sector and attract new\ninvestment.\n    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading\nprimary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s\nfall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its\ncurrency by 31 pct in September.\n    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s\ngovernment appears to be divided over what direction to lead\nthe economy.\n    \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to\nderegulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\"\nthe report says.

Economic\nactivity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export\nearnings from the petroleum industry.\"\n    \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak\ndomestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real\ndeclines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of\ngrowth in agriculture,\" the report states.\n    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is\ncrucial for the government to get the international lending its\nneeds.\n    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance\nof payments support was given partly to help the government\nmaintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS Gulf money markets have grown reasonably\nwell during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain\nto a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf\nInternational Bank BSC> (GIB) said.\n    The bank\'s economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf\ncapital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional\ninvestment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank\naccounts and precious metals.\n    \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with\nmore diversified capital market instruments and a change in the\ndisclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said.\n    The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three\ncategories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.\n    Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of\nshort-term money market instruments and banks in the region had\nfloated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.\n    \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large\nextent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said.\n    Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans\nand bank facilities and very few companies had made use of\nstock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock\nexchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish\nexchanges.\n    But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,\ngovernments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital\nmarkets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.\n    He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had\n\"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital\nmarkets in the region.\"\n    In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,\nfinancial awareness among investors is still lacking and\ninvestment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack\ndepth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted\ninvestors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.\n    Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some\nGulf countries and authorities\' apparent reluctance to adopt\nfinancial innovations had also hampered capital markets.\n    He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation\nof joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.\n    Azzam said capital market instruments should be made\navailable to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi\nArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been\ntaken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to\nown up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.\n    Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth\nfrom the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and\nthe expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi\nArabia.\n    But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi\nArabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal\ndenominated bond issued in 1978.\n    While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading\nin Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal\nexchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,\nAzzam said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

He did not elaborate.\n    Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in\nLagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its\nATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had\ndeclined due to poor demand and high production costs.\n    Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria\'s output was\nless than 1,000 tonnes last year.\n    ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries\'\nexport figures every three months using customs documents and\nmake projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to\nbe breached within the year-long quota period.\n    The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to\nbreach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.\n    They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil\ntheir quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other\nmembers at the ATPC\'s discretion.\n    The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated\n106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.\n    Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with\nthe ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes\nrespectively during the quota period.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Tomorrow\'s topics include\nsavings and investment issues such as consumer credit and\nhousing, and the implications of government budget deficits.\n    These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the\nJapanese government, which is facing increasing domestic\npressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and\nstimulate the sagging economy by spending more.\n    Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of\nboosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.\n    Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge\nU.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade\nimbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is\nbuying more imports.\n    Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft\ntrade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial\ntrade practices. \"It condemns Japan without due process,\" one\nJapanese official said.\n    That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out\nbill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.\n    Japan is also not totally happy with the administration\'s\ntrade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal\naccess to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade\naction by the U.S., Officials said.\n    Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak\nbargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill\noverhanging them.\n    \"We have no leverage,\" one official admitted.\n    As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints\nabout its trade practices in a variety of fields, including\nsuper computers.\n    The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese\nsuper computer market.\n    The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to\npublic institutions like universities which buy the\nsophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up\ninformal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential\nsellers, officials said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS American Express Co, rumored to be\nconsidering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,\nsaid it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit\nthat could improve Shearon\'s access to capital and help it meet\nbroadening international competition.\n    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said\nthe actions under consideration are an integral part of\nAmerican Express\' worldwide financial services strategy and\nthat the two companies have been having both internal and\nexternal discussions on the matters.\n    American Express said no decision has been reached on the\nstrategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately\ndecide to follow growth plans already in place.\n    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the\nfinancial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of\nShearson and there was speculation it may be considering\nselling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the\nspeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of\nthe profitable brokerage firm to the public.\n    There was some speculation that American Express had also\nconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was\nconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.\n     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it\nwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman\nwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remained\nsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American\nExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it\nto a Friday close at 74.\n     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a\nsimilar statement was being circulated to employees.\n    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for\nAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned\nbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50\npct in the last year.\n    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning\noff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock\nprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.\n     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express\'\n1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.\n    American Express\' ambitious plans for international growth\nmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part\nof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of\nShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.\n    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.\n\"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise\ncapital if they need to,\" said Larry Eckenfelder of\nPrudential-Bache Securities.\n    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of\nShearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey\nLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.\n     The reorganization also created four new positions for\nchairmen of Shearson\'s operating divisions, a move analysts\nspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.\n     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does\nlittle to clarify last week\'s market speculation. It does\nconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, which\nunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major\nacquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for\ngrowth and positioning in the global market competition.\n    Late last year, Shearson\'s takeover offer to the E.F.\nHutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said\nthere had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when\nit approached another major Wall Street brokerage.        \n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA> A bidding war for Viacom International\nInc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a\nmanagement group and other investors against National\nAmusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.\n    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source\nclose to the management side insisted that timing was on his\nside. He said if outside directors approve the management\nproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders\nwith proxy material going out late this week. \"It would take 20\ndays from the day we mail,\" said the source.\n    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by\ninvestor Sumner Redstone, would need \"half a year\" to complete\na tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must\naccompany any change in control of Viacom\'s broadcast licenses\nand cable television franchises.\n    Redstone was not available for comment.\n    Some of Wall Street\'s arbitrage players said it was a rare\nsituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One\nsaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and\nif enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to\nthe Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.\n    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a\nmeeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.\n    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One\nmajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. \"We think\nwe\'re at the end now, in terms of bidding,\" said the firm\'s\narbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.\n    Both Redstone\'s proposal and the management proposal would\ncreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The\nmanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5\nbillion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred\nstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.\n    Redstone\'s newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,\na fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a\nvalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock\nstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity\ninterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated\nthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the\ntotal package worth 52 dlrs per share.\n    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable\npreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of\nconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion\nwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.\n    Redstone\'s newest plan raised the amount of interest he\nwould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond\nApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\nduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered\neight pct interest.\n    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management\ngroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,\nwere offering high prices. \"Redstone really wants to own the\ncompany,\" one said. Another said management seemed to have the\nedge on the timing issue.\n    Redstone\'s company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom\'s 35 mln shares.\n    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what\nthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He\nnoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which\nadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally\ntraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now\njust over 30 dlrs.\n    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two\ntwo cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs\nfrom several acquisitions affected results.\n    Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to\n31-1/8.

However, Pesch entered his second offer with\nrepresentation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities\nand Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.\n    \"I don\'t have any doubt that the current transaction can be\nworked out and completed, provided we get to the point where\nAmi management will sit down and talk in a friendly\nenvironment,\" Pesch said.\n    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing\narrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in\nacquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American\nMedical management in place.\n    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to\nform an efficient network of hospitals.\n    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could\nbe made for American Medical.\n    Byron Nimocks of E.F.

'FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS French industry is failing to produce the\ngoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left\nthe government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the\neconomy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment said.\n    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct\nthis year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb\nto 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9\npct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.\n    The report said the French economy was \"increasingly\nill-adapted to demand\" selling goods at \"uncompetitive relative\nprices on both domestic and export markets.\"\n    \"France\'s poor export performance reflects a geographical\nbias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...\nAnd...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18\nmonths,\" it said.\n    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit\nto around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,\nit warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the\nfranc could lead to \"a (renewed) loss of competitiveness\nrelative not only to the United States but also to the newly\nindustrialised countries.\"\n    This could result in further major losses of market share,\nparticularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a\nquarter of French exports, it said.\n    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the\nauthorities would have \"little scope for macroeconomic\nmanoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to\nencourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow\nmore briskly,\" it added.\n    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage\ndemands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a\ntwo pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.\n    Written mainly in December last year, the report took no\naccount of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct\nsurge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the\ngovernment\'s deregulation of service sector tariffs.\n    \"We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke\nrunaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has\nbeen lost,\" one OECD official commented.\n    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil\nprices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the\nreport, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast\nto around 2.5 or three pct.\n    The government last week revised its forecast up to between\n2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year\'s 2.1 pct.\n    But the OECD backed the government\'s view that the\nunderlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,\nwith a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year\'s\nfall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of\ndisinflation.\n    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in\nthe OECD area, the inflation differential between France and\nits main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one\npct this year, it said.\n    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for\nindustrial goods and private services have been rising steeply\nas companies built up their profits.\n    \"For the disinflationary process to continue , and price\ncompetitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange\nrate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,\"\nit said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL The failure of the International Coffee\nOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas\ncould trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at\nleast 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.\n    Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80\ncents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.\n    A special meeting between importing and exporting countries\nended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks\nover how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss\nquotas was set, delegates said.\n    Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the\nInternational Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after\nprices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.\n    With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer\nselling initially and a price war among commercial coffee\nroasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.\n    Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket\nshelf this spring, coffee dealers said.\n    The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and\nexporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the\nbreakdown of the talks.\n    Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and\ndelegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council\nadjourned, \"A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not\nprepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective\ncriteria.\n    \"We want to insure that countries receive export quotas\nbased on their ability to supply the market, instead of their\npolitical influence in the ICO.\"\n    Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster\ncountered, \"Negotiations failed because consumers tried to\ndictate quotas, not negotiate them.\"\n    Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts\nexported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market\nof about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted\nquotas to continue under this basic scheme.\n    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers\nproposed carving up the export market on the basis of\nexportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil\'s\nshare to 28.8 pct.\n    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes\nin many countries\' export capabilities and make coffee more\nreadily available to consumers when they need it.\n    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest\nexporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim\nproposal could not bring the two sides together.\n    Delegates speculated Brazil\'s financial problems,\nillustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on\nbank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to\nprotect its coffee export earnings.\n    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily\non coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and\nColombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO\'s failure\nto agree quotas, analysts said.\n    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as\nmuch as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates\nforecast.\n    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full\ncouncil is not due to meet again until September, delegates\nsaid.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER One of General Electric Co\'s biggest\nbusinesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing\nprofits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,\nWall Street analysts said.\n    Previously, it was expected the business would peak and\ndecline at some point in the next five years. The improved\noutlook results from AMR Corp\'s &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new\nplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.\n    \"Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,\" said\nNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\n    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements\nfor its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>\ntwinjet long distance aircraft.\n    But AMR said it was using \"rent-a-plane leases\" that allow\nit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt\nstructure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the\nplanes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects\nAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe\ndownturn in the economy.\n    From GE\'s point of view the package looks like a good deal\nfor several reasons, Heymann said.\n    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of\ndelivery, Heymann noted.\n    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes\nGE\'s financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,\nwould have little trouble rounding up another airline that\nwanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal\nappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.\n    GE\'s stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by\nmidafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham\nand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company \"no one\norder will have much of an effect on the stock.\"\n    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the\norder \"will help to maintain a good level of production and\nprofitability in the aircraft engine business\" for GE.\n    Heymann sees operating profits from GE\'s jet engine\nbusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs\nby 1991.\n    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last\nyear, with well over half of the business in the military\nsector, according to analysts\' estimates.\n    The rosy outlook for GE\'s jet engine business coincides\nwith an upbeat performance in other segments.\n    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first\nquarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,\nhe believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp\nthat it has a \"unique ability\" to buy a major business and\nreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other\nelements of its 14 business areas.\n    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current\nquarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the\nNBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.\n    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part\ncrediting \"significant benefits from the RCA acquisition.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

Woolworth plans to open 650\nmore specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it\noperated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.\n    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by\nWoolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman\napparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain\nof discount children\'s apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount\ndrug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,\nwhich sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700\nWoolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of\nwhich 1,200 are in the United States.\n    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,\nsaid in a statement, \"These results are especially gratifying as\nthey are an improvement over last year\'s record earnings.\"\n    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in\neach quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier\nperiod.\n    Woolworth\'s variety store operations were hard hit in the\n1970\'s and early 1980\'s by the quickly growing discount store\nindustry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970\'s, Woolworth\nopened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,\na discount apparel chain.

'SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE Soviet winter grains could be off to\na faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall\nand cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.\n    Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the\nSoviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to\nforecast any major crop problems, analysts said.\n    But the situation bears careful watching over the next six\nweeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and\nfuture buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.\n    \"From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that\nthe Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a\nlower crop (than last year),\" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist\nfor E.F. Hutton said.\n    The next six weeks in the USSR\'s grain growing areas will\nbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of\nthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.\n    \"Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of\nus,\" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.\n    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares\nof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.\nThis would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop\nand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the\nUSDA analyst said.\n    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able\nto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts\nnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops\n-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.\n    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover\ncombined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,\nsnowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,\nso the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been\ndue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.\n    \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There\'s a good correlation\nbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said.\n    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal\nin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the\nentire winter crop area, she said.\n    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the\nsnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused \nproblems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior\nforecaster for Accu Weather, said.\n    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the\nfall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,\nthe cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would\nrequire longer off-pasture feeding, they said.\n    \"The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they\ndon\'t have to buy (grains) now,\" a USDA official said.\n    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and\nif they feel that last year\'s huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a\none-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet\nbuying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.\n    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the\nSoviets back into the market, weather analysts said.\n    \"A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and\na half,\" Martell said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT Crude oil prices rallied today, moving\nover 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia\'s determined\neffort to support prices, analysts said.\n    \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,\nhoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without\nanother meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with\nShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\n    \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to\nseasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added.\n    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt\nto get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from\nthe official prices agreed to last december.\n    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,\nSaudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the\nCooperation Council oil ministers\' meeting the previous week.\n    The Saudis have also offered to support members having\ndifficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.\n    \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to\nprevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC\nmember will allocate some of their oil sales to help members\nthat lose sales,\" Margoshes said.\n    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form\nof loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.\n    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line\nnations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it\nis also likely that such assistance would be provided to\nNigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.\n    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC\npresident Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC\nmeeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the\nDecember pact is falling apart.\n    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham\nHarris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been\noversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short\ncovering rally.\"\n    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which\nrefused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners\ninto the market to cover their short positions.\n    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market\nto but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast\nsours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading\nyeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the\nNorth sea crude oil market.\n    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today\nthat Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent\nfor Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels\nbeing fixed to make such shipments.\n    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades\nreported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.\n    OPEC members\' denials that they are producing over their\nquotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.\n    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC\nproduction was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last\ndecember but he gave no details on OPEC production against\nclaims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.\n    \"The production probably is about their quota level and\nlargely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell\nits oil as a result,\" Margoshes said.\n    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the\ncurrent rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if\nSaudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.\n    But others said that despite the rally today there were\nstill several fundamental factors, including demand, which\ncould cut the rally short.\n    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said\nslow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep\ndemand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise\nabout 1.4 pct over 1986.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS Coffee prices may have to fall even lower\nto bring exporting and importing countries once more round the\nnegotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and\ntraders said.\n    The failure last night of International Coffee\nOrganization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree\nexport quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee\nfutures markets today with the London May price reaching a\n4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before\nending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous\nclose.\n    The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.\n    Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the\nICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope\nthe negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor\nunder prices, some senior traders said.\n    The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for\nMarch 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed\nat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it\nis time to go and sell coffee.\"\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade\nsources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a\nprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public\nselling tenders for coffee bought on London\'s futures market\nlast year.\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\nmarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\nfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\nDauster said.\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\n    It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\naccept the producers\' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazil\'s Dauster noted the ICO has\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\nnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\nshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\n    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\nseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\nlapse should lasting agreement not be found.\n    \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\nfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\nand we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.\ncrude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a\nbelief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.\n    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production\ncould push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as\nearly as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.\n    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil\nshould strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the\norganization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a\nbarrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from\nswitching to natural gas supplies.

That gives\ndeficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.\n    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they\nsign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.\n    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,\ntraders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing\nrather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop\nsoybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more\nattractive under normal circumstances.\n    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the\nlimited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,\nmeans farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln\nmore oat acres this year than last without being penalized,\ntraders said.\n    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of\nshifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the\nmore attractive deal from the government, they added.\n    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six\nmonths ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to\nput soybean land back into cotton.\n    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean\nproduction in recent years has been a general shift of acres in\ntraditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,\nwhich are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains\nwith the original borrower.\n    Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of\nswaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some\nportion of the risk but is not required to show it on the\nbalance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient\ncapital to cushion it.\n    Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president\nof Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of\nEngland and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later\ntoday to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital\nstandards for counterparties in swaps.\n    The standards are part of the recently announced\nconvergence agreement between the two countries in which\nregulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements\nfor institutions.\n    McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a\n\"level playing field\" be maintained in the swaps market.\n    He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more\nprimary capital against swap transactions than is the current\npractice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to\nissuers.\n    The issuers might then choose to do business with\nlower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking\nrules.\n    He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for\nswap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort.\n    That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he\nsaid.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER A leaf disease affecting seven pct of\nSri Lanka\'s rubber plantations may reduce output this year and\nraise currently depressed prices, industry officials and\nresearchers told Reuters.\n    About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber\nResearch Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus\n\"corenes pora\" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the\nleaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago.\n    Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the\ncrisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.\nLast year\'s output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000\ntonnes.\n    Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber\nclones if no immediate action is taken.\n    \"The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees\nseriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use\nchemicals to kill the disease,\" an Institute spokesman said.\n    Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at\nPadukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the\nfungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State\nPlantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.\n    The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber\nland with the balance belonging to small private producers with\na total of 145,600 hectares.\n    The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research\nInstitute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for\nplanting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these\nclones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older\nPBX Malaysian clones.\n    Officials at yesterday\'s crisis meeting said it was decided\nto uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be\ntreated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.\n    Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week\nbut prices had hit their lowest since last December. \"If there\nis a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,\" a spokesman\nfor a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.\n    Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about\nfour rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe\none-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this\nweek\'s auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same\nperiod.\n    Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average\nof 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in\nDecember because of wintering in early February in producing\nareas.\n    Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday\'s auction with\nthe supply position showing improvements.\n    Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last\nmonth did not raise prices as on previous occasions.\n    \"Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,\nmeant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of\nthe rubber we already had,\" one buyer said.\n    Other sources said there were few forward contracts and\nspeculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals\naggravated the problem.\n    European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter\nclosures of factories and also in the hope that prices would\nease further.\n    They said another problem that could hit the industry is\nthe dry spell in producing areas. \"If the inter-monsoonal rains\nexpected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further\nshortages,\" one official said.\n    \"But this again could benefit prices,\" a buyer said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE The Federal Reserve Board voted\nunanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of\ninterest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort\nto come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that\ntakes into account the riskiness of a bank\'s loans and other\nassets.\n    Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues\ntoday by the Bank of England.\n    The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.\n    The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks\nassociated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange\ncontracts and similar financial instruments.\n    Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines\nfor calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities\nthat banks would be required to take into account in\ncalculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to\nmaintain.\n    Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans\nand other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that\nwould establish a bank\'s minimum capital needs.\n    The additional guidelines proposed today would determine\nthe amount of capital support required for a bank\'s current\nexposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.\n    The current exposure would be measured by the\nmark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the\nreplacement cost.\n    Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be\ncalculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical\nanalyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking\nregulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the\nasset.\n    The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance\nconflicting needs for precision and simplicity.\n    They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the\nparticular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.\n    Board officials said the new gauge could increase the\ncapital required of the largest money center banks, which are\nthe principal participants in these types of activities.\n    They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the\npotential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to\ncompete in world financial markets.\n    However, the staff concluded, \"The credit risks inherent in\nsuch contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk\nprofiles of some banking organizations.\"\n    The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest\nparticipants in this market, on grounds the benefits of\nincluding the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.\n    Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange\ncontracts traded on organized exchanges.\n    Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was\nnot involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital\nrules.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of\nsocial and structural measures agreed early today by European\nCommunity farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers\nfor reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission\nsources said.\n    The ministers agreed that under this \"extensification\"\nscheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut\noutput of specific products by at least 20 pct.\n    The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and\nwine, they added.\n    Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by\nreducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their\nnumber of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,\nfarmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity\nfor output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.\n    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but\nwill be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on\nthe production they forego.\n    The sources said the package also contains provisions for\npayments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting\nor improving the environment.\n    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured\nfarming areas would be extended to crops. At present such\nallowances are available only for livestock.\n    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into\nalternative farming techniques, the sources added.\n    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen\nsaid the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the\nEC and member states to provide direct income supports for\nrelatively poor farmers.\n    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state\naid would be subject to \"strict criteria to avoid distortion of\ncompetition.\"\n    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a\ndifficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus\nproduction.\n    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night\nproposals to pay \"early retirement\" pensions to farmers aged 55\nor over who gave up production. Those who took their land\ncompletely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to\ntheir heirs, would have received more generous payments.\n    Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised\nproposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme\nagreed.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
'U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal\nReserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to\nmeasure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not\nshow up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.\n    The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options\ninvolving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals\nagreed in January between the two central banks to make\ncommercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar\nstandards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.\n    It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks\nhave until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.\n    The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.\n    \"On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate\ncapital support for potential future exposure -- on the other\nhand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital\nrequirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And\nU.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.\"\n     At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the\nso-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a\ncurrency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its\npotential change in value due to currency or interest rate\nfluctuations until the contract matures.\n    In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance\nsheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of\nfive risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the\nquality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the\ncontract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the\nplans showed.\n    The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would\nnot be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.\n    They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk\nweights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.\nAnd U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national\ngovernment agencies, the proposals showed.\n    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot\nforeign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and\noptions exchanges.\n    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England\nwere keen to encourage banks to \"net\" contracts -- consolidate\nmultiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single\nagreement to create one single payments stream.\n    It recognised that \"such arrangements may in certain\ncircumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their\nfurther development and implementation,\" and said some of the\ncurrent proposals may be changed to take this into account.\n    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot\nforeign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and\noptions exchanges.\n    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England\nwere keen to encourage banks to \"net\" contracts -- consolidate\nmultiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single\nagreement to create one single payments stream.\n    It recognised that \"such arrangements may in certain\ncircumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their\nfurther development and implementation,\" and said some of the\ncurrent proposals may be changed to take this into account.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S. Failure of talks on re-establishing\nInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week\nmay put political pressure on the United States, particularly\nthe State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is\nunlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by\n\"objective criteria\", U.S. officials said.\n    Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head\nof Washington\'s delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his\nreturn from London that the United States is willing to resume\nthe coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.\n    Rosenbaum said the United States will be \"flexible\" in\ndiscussing the method of establishing objective criteria and\nany transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of\nestablishing an objective method of setting quotas.\n    At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,\nproposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated\nby a formula incorporating a producer\'s recent exportable\nproduction and verified stocks, while large producers led by\nBrazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of\nshares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the\nmarket share of Brazil, by far the world\'s largest producer.\n    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support\nlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.\ncustoms service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply\nwith any future coffee quotas.\n    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the\ncoffee policy situation following the collapse of the London\ntalks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\"\n    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee\npolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market\noffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,\nto soften the consumer position.\n    \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will\nkind of want to test the resolve of other producers and\nconsumers,\" said one U.S. official.\n    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said\nBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few\nmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other\ncountries, particularly the splinter group of small producers\nwho differed with the major producers in London.\n    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin\nAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the\nU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in\nthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.\nofficials said.\n    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee\npolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from\npolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.\nofficials said.\n    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia\nat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on\nobjective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica\njoined the splinter group, which said it would agree to\nobjective criteria.\n    There is a strong feeling among some in the State\nDepartment that the United States should continue to support\nthe splinter group of producers who have taken the\npolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective\ncriteria question, U.S. officials said.\n    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be\nsome pressure to reassess positions.\n    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the\nNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on\nthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.\n    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations\nto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.\n    However, U.S. sources said West Germany\'s support was at\ntimes qualified and there is some concern that the European\nCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative to\nproducers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and\nother African producers during the talks.\n    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,\nalthough not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.\n    While political manuevering by small producers and\nconsuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the\nkey to any future outcome will be Brazil\'s position.\n    U.S. officials blamed Brazil\'s intransigence for the\nfailure of the talks and said a more flexible position from\nBrasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

But the rains proved to be a great aid to\nsoybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or\nMay.\n    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum\ncrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields\nand cut the total volume of this year\'s harvest.\n    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,\nwith the heaviest rains in the province\'s western sectors,\nbetween 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10\nand 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40\nmm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.\n    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.\n    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of\nthe coarse grain harvest over last week\'s estimates.\n    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa\nFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of\ntotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.\n    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was\nestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to\nseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the\n1985/86 harvest.\n    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11\nmln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6\nmln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,\nor 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year\'s volume, according to\nofficial figures.\n    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine\npct of total planted area.\n    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers\nfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year\'s figure\nof 3.14 mln hectares.\n    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln\nand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and\n41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the\n1985/86 harvest.\n    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and\nfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to\n1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln\nhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.\n    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and\n3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2\nmillion tonnes harvested in 1985/86.\n    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a\nrecord 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of\n11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year\'s record figure of 7.2 to 7.3\nmln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures\nput last year\'s soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.\n    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good\ncondition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.\n    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is\nexpected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to\n13.8 pct from last year\'s harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.\n Reuter\n&#3;',1

It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing\nrequirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated\n5.6 pct in 1986.\n    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also\ntargeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage\nexports, and production incentives were being considered.\n    \"We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected\ninto the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion\npolicy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and\nlocal private capital come more into play as far as\nmanufacturing capacity is concerned,\" Tigrel said.\n    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish\neconomy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under\nway. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate\npolicy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done\nin a country where the state still dominates industry and the\ncurrency is only partially convertible.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0
'ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION Drilling for oil in California is\nlikely to continue at last year\'s sharply reduced levels\ndespite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts\nsaid.\n    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is\nthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to\nincrease to near 1985\'s levels before any significant recovery\nis seen in drilling, they said.\n    \"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\"\nsaid John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.\n    Few new wells now are being drilled.\n    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,\nwere drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared\nto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil\nInformation Services, which tracks California drilling\nactivity.\n    \"It\'s in the dregs right now,\" said Bolster of the state\'s\ndrilling activity.\n    Current prices are not enough to justify increased\ndrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent\nProducers Association.\n    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact\nto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices\neventually fell.\n    Prices for California\'s marker grade, Line 63 blend, have\nslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high\nof about 17 dlrs.\n    More than half of California\'s oil comes from stripper\nwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that\nmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to\nextract, Malmgreen said.\n    \"It\'s not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\"\nMalmgreen said.\n    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast\nproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland\nwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur\nextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.\n    The outlook for future production in California is clouded\nby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.\n    In the heart of California\'s oil patch, Kern County, which\nproduces about two-thirds of the state\'s oil, exploratory\ndrilling has slowed to a crawl.\n    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in\n1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of\nthe state energy commission. So far this year only five\nexploratory wells have been drilled.\n    \"I don\'t think they\'ll even get to what they did last\nyear,\" Mitchell said.\n    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of\nthe decade, Mitchell said.\n    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the\nnumber of producing wells and overall production.\n    Between February and October of 1986, the number of\nproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from\nmore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy\nCommission.\n    In line with that decrease, California\'s crude oil output\nfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is\nexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.\n    Between February and October 1986, California\'s crude oil\nproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels\nper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.\n    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986\nwas 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405\nmln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of\nConservation.\n    \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\"\nGuerard said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

Analysts\nagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \ndiffered sharply over the carmaker\'s long term prospects.\n    \"I\'m very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\nPeabody and Co. \"They\'re clearly committed to enhancing\nshareholder value.\"\n    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\nbuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\nrecapture lost market share.\n    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\nback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\nannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\nwith more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\n    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\nstock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\nleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\ngood performance expected from new car models.\n    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\nrepurchase program is not a positive.\n    \"The buyback doesn\'t really change the earnings outlook and\nputs more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will\nhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock\nshould settle back down to around 76, he added.\n    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and\n5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.\nHealy\'s numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,\nwhich range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four\ndlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.\n    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM\'s share of the domestic\ncar and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are\nnot selling as well as their competitors,\" he said.\n    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the\nyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and\nChrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February\nsales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects\nimprovement in coming months.\n    Overall, GM\'s share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall\nto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,\nanalysts said. The numbers include imports.\n    Kidder Peabody\'s Kirnan said cost reductions and product\nimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the\nfourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.\n    \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it\'s rolling up\nits sleeves and getting serious. I think there\'s a major\nearnings surprise in the winds,\" he said.\n    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in\npart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning\n5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more\nconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuation\nwith respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said.\n    Another positive for the stock is GM\'s dividend, currently\nfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than\nits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash\ndividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.\n    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\nsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM\'s new products, if\nsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its\nmarket share.\n    \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will\nonly curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around\n35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.\n    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle\nof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he\nsaid results will not improve until 1988.\n    \"I\'m not looking for improvement this year. This is a\ntransition year for GM,\" he said.\n    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988\nat 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not\naffect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn\'t so much what they\nearn this year. It\'s the momentum beyond this year that\'s\nimportant.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS Texas Railroad Commissioner James\nNugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for\nCongress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt\nincentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance\ntaxes on oil produced from stripper wells.\n    Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of\nrepresentatives that the state must take the initiative in\nmolding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist\ntroubled oil producers.\n    His proposal to revitalize Texas\' oil industry would exempt\nstripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day\nfrom the state\'s 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the\nmajority of Texas\' oil wells fall within the stripper well\ncategory and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be\ncrucial in determining if the well remains in production.\n    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new\nwildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years\nas a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.\n    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of\nproduction that inject water or gas into the ground to recover\noil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent\nsaid. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary\nwells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day\nfor three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a\nbarrel.\n    \"We\'ve been sitting back and waiting on two federal\nadministrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the\nnation to follow.

'NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking\nbanks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion\nthem against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency\nswap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.\n    After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by\nthe Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said\nthat in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside\nreserves twice for the same risk.\n    Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the\nproposals.\n    Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially\nsignificant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume\nof about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled\nby Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in\neurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved\nin some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that\nabout 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are\noutstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the\nInternational Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of\nKleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association\nhas no comment and will study the proposals.\n    \"What they are proposing is really double counting,\" Patrick\nde Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley\nand Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be\nrequired to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct\nper year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of\nreplacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.\n    \"The potential risk factors are very large relative to what\nwe had expected,\" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.\n\"What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --\nto borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might\nhave 10 years from now,\" he added.(Adds title first paragraph).\n    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by\nthe agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a\ncompetitive advantage because they will not have to pass the\ncosts on to customers.\n    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the\nexclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal\nReserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the\nproposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that\nJapan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new\ncapital rules.\n     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank\nregulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,\noffsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single\ncounterparty against each other.\n    The paper said that regulatory authorities \"recognize that\nsuch arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce\ncredit risk.\" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting\nagreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it\nmight be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.\n    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an\nairtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.\n     \"One problem is that there has never been a major default\nin the swaps market. So we don\'t know if any of the swap\narrangements will really stand up in court,\" said one bank\nofficial.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

The TWA offer was announced shortly\nafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.\n    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It\nalso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and\nthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer\nfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.\n    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for\nUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said\nit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the\nairlines.\n    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman\nCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into\nthe takeover arena.\n    \"We\'re just wondering if he\'s not just trying to get TWA\ninto play. There\'s speculation on the street he just wants to\nmove onto somthing else,\" said one arbitrager. \"We think TWA\nmight just be putting up a trial balloon.\"\n    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,\nbut that the airline will probably reject it because the price\nis relatively low compared to other airline deals.\n    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by\nrevealing financing arrangements. \"They need to show their\ncommitment and their ability to finance. I think it\'s a\ncredible offer,\" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.\n    \"I think it\'s certainly on the low end of relative values\nof airline deals,\" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would\nbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.\n    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A\nspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not\nchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of\nthat airline\'s stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance\nfor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.\n    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln\nshares.\n    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also\nremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding\n65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.\n    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with\nits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont\nand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover\nof Piedmont.\n    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to\nmake his own airline a more attractive takeover target.\n    \"Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there\nwere no takers. I think the strategy might have called for\nmaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish\nthat specific objective is to go out and acquire other\nairlines,\" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.\n    \"I don\'t know whose going to buy them, but at least this\nway it becomes a much more viable package,\" said Kim.\n    But Icahn\'s financing ability for such a transaction\nremains in doubt, in part because of TWA\'s heavy debt load.\n    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do\nthe offer.\n    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial\nadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.\n   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>\nand still retains 11 pct of that company\'s stock.\n    Some Wall street sources said the financier\'s USX plan was\nimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham\nLambert Inc, because of Wall Street\'s insider trading scandal.\n    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA\noffer on price and financing concerns. \"It\'s littered with\ncontingencies and it doesn\'t even have a financing\narrangement,\" said one executive at another major airline.\n    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a\nstrong contender with USAir\'s east coast route system and\nplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the\nintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in\nits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,\nto the mix would develop an even stronger force.\n    The combined entity would also have TWA\'s pars reservation\nsystem.\n    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would\nresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the\nyen\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact\nthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major\nEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate\ndistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.\n    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements\nby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the\ncurrency movements of the past two years are also creating a\nfundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new\ntrade tensions and imbalances.\n    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are\nalready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-\nEuropean Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.\n    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international\ncooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between\nthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down\nthe value of the dollar was a historic one.\n    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major\ncurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which\nthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not\nnecessarily central significance, the officials said.\n    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took\nplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar\'s peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don\'t expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\nand this year we may have to do so again,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT The outlook for the West\nGerman economy is relatively bright, with gross national\nproduct expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel\nUniversity\'s Institute for World Economy said.\n    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading\neconomic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic\nthan that of the other institutes, some of which have recently\nreduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.\n    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany\'s export\noutlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark\'s\nstrength against the dollar and other major currencies.\n    \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in\nall, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight rise\nin exports can be expected.\"\n    The institute said past experience has shown West German\nexporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by\ncutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting\ntheir product ranges.\n    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in\neconomic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the\ndecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow\nthis year.\n    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed\nadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both\nof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary\npolicy, the institute said.\n    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight\nimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hire\nadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by\nagreed reductions in working hours.\n    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of\nmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked\nacceleration of inflation.\n    It also warned that what it called the worldwide\nsynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new\nglobal recession. It said central banks in industrialized\ncountries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal\nReserve Board\'s expansionary course.\n    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead\neventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.\nPolicy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks\nwere likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could\naggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as\nincrease protectionism around the world.\n    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the\nnegative effects of the global synchronization of monetary\npolicy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of\ngrowth at home.\n    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that\nfiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes\nshould be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and\nwage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than\nin 1986.

'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its\neconomy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington\nto take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining\nrestrictions two weeks ago.\n    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown\nof the figure, saying it takes into account a number of\nhypothetical losses. Some of them are \"too sophisticated to\nconvert into financial terms,\" one banking source said.\n    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is\nimpossible to calculate.\n    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland\'s\neconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.\n    \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-\nachieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only\ncontributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said.\n    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured\nNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation\nfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under\nmartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was\noriginally devised several years ago by the Institute of\nNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planning\ncommission.\n    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish\neconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth\ntrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in\ncredits from Western commercial and government lenders.\n    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was\nbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing\nthe estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point,\nwhich has no real scientific evaluation.\"\n    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to\nthe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs\nannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were\nimposed.\n    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to\n200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade\nsurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs\nagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.\n    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important\nU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,\nchemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits\ndried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is\naccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for\npolitical reasons,\" said one expert. \"It\'s an illusion based on a\nmisunderstanding of Western economy.\"\n    \"There\'s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\nwho has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that\nPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\nin the 1970s which were no longer today\'s reality.\n    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one\ndiplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\nand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\nscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\nlifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\non Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\nand lacks the means to modernise its industry.\n    \"MFN doesn\'t really mean anything, only that Poland will not\nbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\nregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\nin play now,\" said one Western envoy.\n    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\nquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\nmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\nPoland\'s efforts to regain entry.\n    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\nthis fact recently.\n    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making\nup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\ndifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\ntwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\nexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\"\n    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\nhas a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\nimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said\n\"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing\nof the Polish economy won\'t cut any ice. The Americans will\njust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing\nSolidarity.\"\n    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in\ntalks in Washington last week with the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was\nlooking for a lead from the United States.\n    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its\nfinancial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short\ntime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its\nforeign economic partners.\"\n    He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to\nplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland\'s partners\ninterested in the settlement of Polish debt.\"\n    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed\nWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and\nParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and\nsaid it should now play a more positive role.\n    \"As a major superpower the United States can influence\ninternational organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings\naimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to\nwhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

This follows a steady decline in the call\nmoney rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance\nMinistry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.\n    The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of\nthe meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five\nindustrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored\nconsiderable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks\nof turbulence.\n    The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February\n23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily\ndown to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,\nwhere it has now stabilised.\n    Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb\nliquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.\n    While call money has dropped by well over a percentage\npoint, the Bank of France\'s money market intervention rate has\nremained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight\npct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.\n    The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at\n8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.\n    The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase\nrate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while\nusing the intervention rate to set the floor.\n    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said\nthat he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers\nsaid any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come\nwhen the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,\nalthough an earlier cut could not be excluded.\n   A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early\nas tomorrow morning, banking sources said.\n    They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an\nacceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging\nthe authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also\npointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving\nscope for a small fall in rates.\n    M-3 money supply, the government\'s key aggregate, finished\n1986 within the government\'s three to five pct growth target,\nrising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earnings\nfor 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market\nconditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to\ndifferent accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said.\n    The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,\nwhile the additional effect of currency movements reduced the\ncontribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.\n    The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the\nyear to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with\nlower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by\nvolume.\n    Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at\nthe top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading\nPlc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg\nfrom a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a\ngeneral collapse in exploration and production volumes was\npartially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln\nstg from 205 mln in 1985.\n    Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected\ncurrency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter\nresults, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding\nforecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete\nWedd noted.\n    However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in\nperformance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the\nimprobability that the group would be able to repeat the high\nrefining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.\n    The impact of recovering oil prices would come through\nfaster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a\nhigh proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which\ntypically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year\nlag, analysts said.\n    Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third\nquarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.\n    Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in\nthe period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in\nU.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group\nhad increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes\nadded.\n    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue\nU.S. Exploration activity. \"Exploration is currently pretty\nflat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no\nmassive upturn,\" he said.\n    A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North\nSea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.\n    Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. \"If\nyou are not exploring you are not going to find anything,\" he\nnoted.\n    U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day\n(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed\nbelow 20 dlrs a barrel.\n    This favored OPEC\'s attempts to stabilise prices, as the\nlower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC\nmarginal production shutting down. \"OPEC has done pretty\nextraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,\"\nhe added.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
'BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain\'s\ndecision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings\nbanks, saying it reflected the socialist government\'s\ndetermination not to ease up in the fight against inflation\ndespite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.\n    The central bank last night raised the requirement by one\npercentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess\nliquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.\n    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the\nBank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to\nchoke off money supply growth.\n    \"I think it\'s a good measure,\" a senior foreign banker said.\n\"It\'s a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates\nand avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.\"\n    \"It shows that the political will is very strong. They know\nthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitive\nand bring down unemployment in the long run,\" he added.\n    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month\nago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise\nin reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of\nraising interest rates.\n    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now\n-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money\nfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish\nexports less competitive.\n    The government says industry\'s competitiveness is also\nbeing hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was\nway above that of Spain\'s major trading partners in the\nEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago.\n    To help meet this year\'s target of five pct, it is\ninsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for\nclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough\nsacrifices.\n    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose\ndemands essentially involve more government spending, have\nbecome an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe\nGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.\n    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have\nsome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the\nmoney market too hard.\n    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key\novernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at\ntoday\'s auction. The rate has been increased nine times since\nthe start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.\n    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in\nany case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate\nbanks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.\n    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the\npublication of the decree in today\'s official gazette. Bankers\nsay the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,\ninevitably, push lending rates higher.\n    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which\nbanks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect\ntomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month\nthat it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher\ninterest rates.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY French official reserves fell 45.06\nbillion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from\n421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry\nsaid in a statement.\n    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign\ncurrency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the\nEuropean Monetary System (EMS).\n    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs\nduring the month, the ministry said.\n    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through\noperations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,\ncounterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from\nthe quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held\nwith the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).\n    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc\ndeficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a\nresult of using very short-term financing instruments.\n    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and\nother central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange\nmarkets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in\nan attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight\nof funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the\nfranc.\n    On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against\nthe French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.\n    The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves\nto 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74\nbillion at end December.\n    Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.\n    Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion\nfrancs from 75.27 billion at end December.\n    Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln\nfrancs to 19.31 billion francs.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY A study of salmonella poisoning has\nuncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding\nantibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that\ncan infect humans and resist medicines.\n    Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control\ntracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is\nresistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the\nresulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote\nthe growth of cattle.\n    Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of\nantibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have\nbeen warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs\nis helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.\n    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases\nthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect\nhumans.\n    But the new study, reported in Thursday\'s New England\nJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.\n    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number\nof people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant\ninfection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to\n298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the\nvictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized\nfor their illness.\n    They also discovered that cooking the meat didn\'t always\nprevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating\nraw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, \"the\nmajority of cases appear to have been caused by eating\nhamburger that was at least partially cooked.\"\n    The researchers said the results show that \"food animals are\na major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections\nin humans, and that these infections are associated with\n(antibiotic) use on farms.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'DUTCH GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW, JOBLESS RISE IN 1987 Leaks of a major Dutch official\neconomic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate\nreduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this\nyear, political and market sources say.\n    Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness\nthis year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage\nincrease, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some\ncalls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.\n    But whatever the government\'s response, the central bank\nwill stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.\n    The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)\npublishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will\nalso see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and\nthe economy.\n    Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate\nreflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch\neconomic growth was now seen around one pct.\n    Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the\ndecline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West\nGermany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,\nPierson said in its February economic outlook.\n    The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct\ngrowth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of\n2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.\n    The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the\ngovernment has already admitted it will not meet its goal of\nreducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.\n    Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central\nbank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if\nnecessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.\n    Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised\nthe guilder\'s revaluation in line with the West German mark in\nlast January\'s European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and\nexpressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.\n    But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy\nhad become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the\ndollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.\n    Some analysts also question the central bank\'s decision not\nto copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead\nlower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.\n    Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move\nsaying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on\nthe money market, noting \"the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the\nmoment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already\nfar below the market rates.\"\n    Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of\nthe Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest\nrate policies serve that goal.\n    Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands\nrecently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold\nto take profits.\n    Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would\nreduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more\ndificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch\ninterest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued\ncompletely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.\n    Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision\nnot to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson\nwarned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.\n    Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry\nand the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having\nsaid before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower\nDutch rates but that the Germans should move first.\n    One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down\nto reduce the government debt burden.\n    A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were\nneeded but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between\nthe ministry and the central bank. \"The cabinet\'s policy is\nsteady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT The Bank of England again fought against\nmoney and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate\ncut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise\nin its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.\n    It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct\nof its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued\nto buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and\nthe possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.\n    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can\nstop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want\nto.\n    The Bank\'s latest strong signal to the market that it wants\nrates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when\nit lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to\nrelieve a money market shortage.\n    \"They\'re really making the discount houses suffer,\" said\nStephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.\n\"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.\"\n    This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by\nany sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had\ninhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came\nstrongly into the pound.\n    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London\nclose, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60\nmarks, up from 2.8720/50.\n    \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that\nrates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economist\nat finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.\n    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the\nbase rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.\n    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be\nconvinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating\nrather than a result of short-term speculative gains.\n    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said\nPeter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.\n    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of\na Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and\ndisappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to\nhold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback\nfor bonds, Fellner said.\n    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most\nforecasts say it will be this year.\n    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to\noil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.\n    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set\nthe timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.\n    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable\nrate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.\n    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least\na proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term\ncapital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.\n    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet\nthan the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and\ncurrent political upheavals in Washington.\n    The Bank may want to see another few points on the\ntrade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But by\nthen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of\nEngland,\" he added.\n    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting\npressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources\nsaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more\nthan just marking up by foreign exchange traders.\n    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially\nharmful news on the trade front, today\'s figures showing that\nthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.\n    This was above previous estimates of the current account\ndeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.\n    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would\nhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they\nwere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.\n    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing\nbanks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank\nofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this\nweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.\nIf a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point\ncut, with another half or full point about Budget day.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'FED\'S JOHNSON STRESSES PRICE STABILITY Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman\nManuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was\ncritical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the\nworld and said that progress was being made.\n    \"It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve\'s\npromotion of price stability is critical to the successful\nimplementation of virtually all of the important ingredients\nfor growth,\" he told the Eastern Economic Association.\n    Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of\nfronts. \"Federal Reserve monetary policy, the\nGramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the\nBaker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the\nright direction,\" he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain,\nFrance, Japan, West Germany and Canada.\n    On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise\nnumerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment\ntoward slowing the growth of federal spending.\n    There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National\nProduct were declining and would continue to drop, he said.\n    But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign\ncapital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep\ninterest rates stable.\n    \"This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.\nSooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive\nfederal spending,\" he said.\n    A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the\nmain objective of the Fed, Johnson said.\n    He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of\nexchange rates was needed for long-term growth.\n    On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against \"quick fix\"\nsolutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation\nor protectionist trade legislation.\n    \"What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy\nreturns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine\neconomic growth,\" he said.\n    Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow\nfor its gradual resolution over time.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the\nyen\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact\nthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major\nEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate\ndistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.\n    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements\nby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the\ncurrency movements of the past two years are also creating a\nfundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new\ntrade tensions and imbalances.\n    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are\nalready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-\nEuropean Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.\n    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international\ncooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between\nthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down\nthe value of the dollar was a historic one.\n    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major\ncurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which\nthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not\nnecessarily central significance, the officials said.\n    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took\nplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar\'s peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don\'t expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\nand this year we may have to do so again,\" he said.\n REUTER...\n&#3;',0

'HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE A House Agriculture Committee meeting\nlater today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a\ndebate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or\n\"de-coupling,\" provision to cover feedgrains, and those who\noppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources\nsaid.\n    The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year\n0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter\nwheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and\nstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.\n    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be\nexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.\n    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision\nwill emerge from the committee, the sources said.\n    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large\nestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates\nby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.\n    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this\ntime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of\nthe bill, committee staffers said.\n    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A\nconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and\nstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.\n    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an\nexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of\nthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup\nfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.\n    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so\nsomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be\nimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.\n    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last\nweek\'s subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee\nchairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the\nconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was\nnecessary.\n    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn\nGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen\'s\nAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.\n    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill\ncurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it\nshould be extended to other crops.\n    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said\nGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.\n    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to\ndecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the\ndebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.\n    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce\na bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the\nargument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major\nchanges in the farm bill.\n    \"Stenholm\'s bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the\ntiming,\" a congressional staff member said.\n    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an\namendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988\nfeedgrains.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> Carl Icahn\'s bold takeover bid for\nUSAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,\nwhich was being courted by USAir.\n    Yesterday, Icahn\'s Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4\nbillion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\naccepting the bid.\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahn\'s 52 dlr per share offer and\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\ntakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.\n    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was\noff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\nit would be taken over.\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\n   \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager.\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir\'s bid will\nsucceed.\n    Piedmont\'s largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\nSouthern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\nleast likely to be bought.\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn\'s\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\ncontingencies.\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\n    \"You can\'t discount him,\" said one arbitrager.\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\n    \"It\'s clear Icahn wants to sell and he\'s bluffing,\" said\none arbitrager.\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\nabout six dlrs per share.\n    Some analysts believe Icahn\'s proposed three-way airline\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\nacquired separately.\n    \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\nwork,\" said one analyst.\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA\'s wage\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\nanalysts said.\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines\'\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\ncompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way\nfor him to exit the company if USAir\'s airline is then merged\ninto TWA.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'HUGHES &lt;HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed\nHughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a\nproposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO>, Wall\nStreet analysts said.\n    Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was\noff. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from\nHughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said\nit was still interested in the merger.\n    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its\ntroubles could make it a takeover candidate.\n    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas\ninvestor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters\nhe is not interested.\n    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities\nand Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in\nsome publicly traded company. He declined to identify the\ntarget other than to rule out Hughes.\n    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes\nturnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of\nHughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the\nHughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.\n    Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a\nmerger, and Baker\'s response that a merger is still possibile,\nanalysts said no one could be certain where the situation was\ngoing.\n    \"I think the merger is not going through,\" said Phil Pace,\nanalyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger \"lost a\nlot of its appeal\" when the U.S. Department of Justice required\nthat Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.\n    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of\nthe total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said \"30 to 40\npct of the cost savings are tied up in that.\"\n    \"They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,\"\nsaid James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.\n\"Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but\nwhether they will alter their position, I don\'t know.\n    \"It\'s getting a little confusing,\" said James Carroll,\nanalyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited\nby Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger \"tend to be weak.\"\nHughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it\nwanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,\nthe projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer\nperiod of time.\n    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the\ncompanies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker\napparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.\n    Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln\ndlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling\nReed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be\nsaved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.\n    Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first\nsigned \"the outlook for the industry has improved materially.\"\nHughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry\nis lifting.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT Key members of the House Agriculture\ncommittee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a\npending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a\nbroader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later,\nCongressional sources said.\n    The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn\nEnglish (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support\nan amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm\n(D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop\nwinter and spring wheat.\n    This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original\nproposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987\nwheat only. That provision was later broadened by the\nsubcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.\n    Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still\ncollect 92 pct of deficiency payments.\n    Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed\nuntil next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill\nand 0/92.\n    The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program\nfollows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential\nfarm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,\nand by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.\n    Congressional sources said there has not been enough time\nto study the implications of a broad 0/92.\n    \"The timing (of the proposal) is off,\" said one aide to a\nHouse Agriculture committee member.\n    However, several Congressional sources said they expect a\nbroader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House\nAgriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make\nspending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part\nof an overall deficit reduction package.\n    Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley\n(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture\'s share of budget cuts may\nexceed one billion dlrs.\n    A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the\nCongressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration\nestimate it would result in significant budget savings.\n    A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all\n1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5\nbillion dlrs over five years.\n    Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the\napproach of planting season, Congressional sources said.\n    Some officials said it already is late for implementation\nof a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for\nwheat and feedgrains.\n    If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either\nwould have to be extended or reopened, sources said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS Brazil\'s recent announcement of a\nsuspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign\ndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views\namong many international economists and commodities analysts\nthat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.\n    The developing world\'s most indebted nation is also its\nmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as\ncoffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange\nrevenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.\n    \"That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no\nway they can trade their way out of this situation,\" Aldo\nRoldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase\nEconometrics, said.\n    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the\nproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted\nworld markets, but also had to work to make its position on\nforeign exchange markets more profitable.\n    \"Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and\nexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange\nrates,\" Roldan said.\n    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were\ndepressed and generally did not appear very promising for a\ncountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50\npct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23\nbillion dlrs.\n    But he added: \"They are always pretty aggressive and they\nhave good foreign marketing channels.\"\n    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be\ncoffee, and even without background pressure from foreign\ncreditors the world\'s largest producer was expected to hit the\nmarket this year with a vengeance.\n    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization\n(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up\nearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing\neach other of intransigence.\n    \"Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,\nwhich others wanted changed,\" one senior coffee dealer said.\n    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to\npreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said\nBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others\nwould suffer.\n    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but\nas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the\ndealer said.\n    \"If they do come into the market at this level it will go\nlower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,\"\nhe said.\n    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents\nlower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant\ndeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.\n    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster\ntold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has\nno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of\nthe ICO talks on export quotas.\n    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the\nfocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. \"They\nwill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\"\naccording to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache\nSecurities Inc.\n    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus\ndifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the\nBrazil soybean crop. \"Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and\nthey can\'t afford to store the crops,\" he said.\n    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time\nabout large South American crops developing under near ideal\nconditions towards record yields.\n    \"We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than\nusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,\" Loewy said.\n    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean\nAssociation (ASA), said this year\'s Brazilian soybean harvest\ncould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.\n    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices\nare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the\nvulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.\n    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a\nreduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to\nfarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.\n    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the\nsoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices\nby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can\nforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the\nloan.\n    \"We\'re getting into a period when they (Brazil) are\nstarting to harvest and starting to export,\" Eshleman said. But\nhe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below\n10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.\n    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel\nBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much\nas it can this year because of its economic situation.\n    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. \"The\nBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for\nstorage,\" he added.\n    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil\nwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said\nit would not make a big difference.\n    On other commodity markets, Brazil\'s selling impact may be\nmuted no matter its need to generate capital.\n    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which\ncould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The\ncountry may have oversold and be unable to honor export\ncommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by\nconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will\ngive it little room to stretch exports, they said.\n    Brazil\'s other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of\nsurplus. \"Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it\nfell, so I don\'t think they can start throwing out cocoa and\nfind many more markets for it,\" one analyst said.\n    \"If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would\ncollapse and they can\'t afford to do that,\" she added.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY U.S. money supply growth is slowing\ndown rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the\nFederal Reserve\'s main monetary aggregates may even have\ncontracted in February.\n    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the\nFed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid\ngrowth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the\nweeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy\nwas justified on account of weakness in the economy.    \n    M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported\ntoday, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary\nforecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.\nThe monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.\n    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.\nWith other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit\naccounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is\nset for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.\n    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional\nlink to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of\nfalling interest rates and banking deregulation.\n    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is\nlikely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch\nEconomics Inc.\n    \"The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they\'re all\nsending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows\nat the Fed,\" McCarthy said.\n    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, \"We\nhave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It\'s\ncoming in a lot weaker than I thought.\"    \n    The economists were quick to caution that one month\'s data\nprove nothing, especially because money growth previously had\nbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct\nrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.\n    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be\nexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the\nbooming stock market and is thus not an indication of a\nslowdown in the business expansion.\n    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond\nmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a\nreflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.\n    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with\nsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter\nprogresses. \"Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as\nthey were a month ago,\" he noted.\n    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and\nrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.\n    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct\nor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate\nenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national\nproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. \"You\'d\ncertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\"\n    There was certainly nothing in the Fed\'s latest balance\nsheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under\nway, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line\nwith expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc\nargued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to\nsolve America\'s most urgent economic problem, its massive trade\ndeficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar\ndepreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to\nclose the trade gap, Brusca said \"I\'m not prepared to be all\nthat optimistic about the bond market.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

The average manufacturing work week rose\n0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since\nNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said.\n    \"The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very\nlarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7\npct,\" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4\npct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.\n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc\nnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour\nin February from 8.83 dlrs in January.\n    \"Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means\nwe\'ll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis\nthe wage and salary disbursement,\" he said.\n    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should\nrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.\n    He said the February employment gains are consistent with\nhis firm\'s first quarter U.S. real gross national product\ngrowth forecast of 3.7 pct.\n    Economists agreed that the employment data were negative\nfor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy\nand no easing in the Federal Reserve\'s monetary policy. But\nmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.\n    \"This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider\neasing,\" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  \n  \"It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,\" he\nsaid. \"If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,\nbut it\'s most likely they\'ll sit and wait.\"\n    \"The data have not been uniform,\" Stone added. \"Durable\ngoods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\"\n    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,\nfollowed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.\nretail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap\nwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs.\n    \"Things just aren\'t adding up,\" said Steve Slifer of Lehman\nGoverment Securities Inc. \"Consumer spending, capital spending,\ngoverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first\nquarter GNP growth of one pct,\" he said.\n    \"The employment and production data point to a big\ninventory build-up, but that\'s what we thought in the fourth\nquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\"\n    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000\nin January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was\naccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery\nindustries returning to work.\n    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains\nhave resulted from an improving trade outlook.\n    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.\ntrade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports\ngrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in\nimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve\nin the first quarter.\n    \"Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,\nbut evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper\nproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show\nthat trade is improving,\" Benderley said.\n    \"The economy is moving between extremes,\" he said. \"Some\nreports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter\nGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\"\n    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater\npart of February\'s employment gain. Retail services employment\nrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in\nJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.\n    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But\nthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down\nfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.\n    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in\nFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at\n6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since\nMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.\n    \"The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\"\nCarson said. \"This takes away the Fed\'s flexibility to ease,\nbut there\'s no reason to tighten. It\'s way too early for that.\"\n      \n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES This week\'s Bank of England resistance to\nstrong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in\nholding bank base rates at 11 pct.\n    But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson\'s policy, stated at the end of the Paris\nGroup of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling\nbroadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources\nsaid.\n    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing\ntrade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the\nParis meeting and up 0.4 on the day.\n    Today\'s peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.\n    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted\na substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is\ntherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.\n    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe\nLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see the\ntrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this action\nover the last few weeks, sterling\'s only just within striking\ndistance of that range,\" he said.\n    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some\nbroad target range around this area.\n    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the\npound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of\na loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.\n    \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they\nare, what\'s to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executive\ndirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London\nforeign exchange market.\n    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active\nselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of\ngeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helped\nkeep it below 1.60 dlrs.\n    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and\n1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.\n    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling\nheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it\nholds around these levels.\n    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest\nrate boat. \"If rates don\'t come down, the market will say they\nought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said.\n    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" being\ninvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight\nor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short\nnotice.\n    However, the authorities will hope that at least a\nproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.\n    \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and\nhave to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey,\neconomist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.\n    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for\nsterling, at least in the near term.\n    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point\nabout March 17, Budget Day.\n    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the\nBudget, said Temperton.\n    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the\nrun-up to a general election, the major factor behind current\nbullishness in the government bond and currency markets.\n    \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.\nHe wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate\ncut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the\nequities arm of Mercury International Group.\n    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the\nway lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in\nthe weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last\nFriday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.\n    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11\n3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest\nsince base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.\n    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months\nmoney, banking sources said the market could not take the cut\nas a guide to the Bank\'s intentions on short term rates.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 \ndlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price\ncould rise another dollar as inventories fall.\n    \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market\nthere is tight supply of crude with short transportation time\nto major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst\nwith Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices\n50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added.\n    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to\n18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.\n    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in\nFebruary more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a\nbarrel.\n    \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that\noil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its\n15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come\nunder question,\" McKinley said.\n    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly\nreport said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in\nindustrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during\nthe first quarter of this year.\n    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first\nquarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose\ninventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln\ntonnes, or about 74 days consumption.\n    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd\ndraw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday\nfed speculation that other major companies were destocking.\n    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a\nso-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying\nofficially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization\nto offer discounts to the official price.\n    \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the\nultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively\nsoon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\"\nthe general trading manager of an international oil company\ntold Reuters in a telephone interview.\n    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting\nexcess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own\noutput, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to\nbe 14.7 mln bpd this week.\n    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend\noil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.\n    \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000\nbpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,\nthe larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting\nit to be there,\" McKinley said.\n    International oil traders said that other short-haul\ncrudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian\nrefiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily\navailable Mideast crudes earlier this week.\n    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up\nthe price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading\nmanagers at several companies told Reuters.\n    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long\nOPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.\n    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity\nManagement, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the\nSaudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it\ngives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\"\n     He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other\nmembers who produce over their quota, and the drain on the\nSaudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low\nas 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added.\n    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the\nspot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.\n    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery\ninto the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which\ntraded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of\n18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.\n    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far\nEast at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.\n    \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government\ndeals, which are below official prices and this is probably\nbeing resold,\" one international trader said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

It has\nbeen under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in\nDecember, 1985.\n    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of\n55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank\ntruck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet\nmilling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most\ncommonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other\nbeverages.\n    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production\nfacilities designated by the exchange.

'BRAZIL STRIKES CAUSE GOVERNMENT MAJOR PROBLEMS Strikes by Brazil\'s 40,000\nseamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing\nmajor headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt\ncrisis.\n    A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25\nyears and union leaders say they have seriously affected\nBrazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.\n    On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest\npayments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp\ndeterioration in its trade balance.\n    Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most\npetrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country\'s industrial\nheartland, and in three other states closed down to press for\nhigher fuel prices.\n    There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages\ncould lead to a serious fuel shortage.\n    The seamen\'s leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the\n72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.\n    The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today\nentitled \"Dangerous Confrontation,\" said: \"From the economic\npoint of view the seamen\'s strike carries an alarming cost,\nwith grave consequences for the supply situation and for the\ncountry\'s external trade.\"\n    The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected\noffers of up to 100 pct.\n    Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due\nto rule on whether the seamen\'s strike is legal. But a senior\nofficial of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao\nFranco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless\nof the tribunal\'s ruling.\n    Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse\nover the last few months of the government\'s Cruzado Plan price\nfreeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not\nonly workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station\nowners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao\nPaulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.\n    Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of\nCuritiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for\nexceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.\n    Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their\nprofits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six\nU.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).\n    Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last\nnight as motorists filled up their tanks while they still\ncould.\n    Political sources said the government of President Jose\nSarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel\nsupply situation.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

The\nEncor shares do not pay dividends.\n    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked\nwhether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.\n    At current market prices, Dome\'s stake in Encor would be\nvalued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines\nshares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.\n    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also\nprompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the\nCanadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.\n    \"Encor\'s stock price has improved quite substantially in\nrecent weeks with a runup in crude prices,\" Peters and Co Ltd\noil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.\n    \"The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it\nsold at these levels because they can get more for it now than\nthey have been able to in recent years,\" he added.\n    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at\n7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six\ndlrs in early February.\n    The company also recently set up its own operating\nmanagement, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,\nMaison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.\n    Dome and Encor \"are actually going to get farther apart. So\n(the sale) does make a lot of sense,\" Mote said.\n    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest\nEncor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale\nproceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome\'s debt to\nCommerce Bank.\n    \"I think they\'ll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as\nthey can,\" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.\n    Some of Dome\'s group of 56 major creditors might move to\nblock such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.\n    \"Other creditors generally all want to make sure that\nsomething they might be able to get a piece of is not being\nsold out from under them,\" said analyst Gobert.\n    Another stumbling block would be Encor\'s 225 mln dlr joint\nliability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic\nPetroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.\n    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the\npossible sale of Dome Petroleum\'s interest in Dome Mines.\n    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum\'s\ndebt and has a \"right of consent\" to the sale of Dome Petroleum\'s\nholding.\n    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares\nwould seek some type of relief on the company\'s debt\nobligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.\n    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what\nprice the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,\nbut said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share \"are very\nattractive.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION Advocates of a 0/92 plan for\nfeedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a\ndisaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is\nscaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional\nsources said.\n    The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English\n(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to\nimplement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.\n    An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987\nwheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that\nscaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.\n    Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,\nit is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should\nbe treated equally, they said.\n   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then\nsupporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not\noffer their proposals next week, sources said.\n   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles\nStenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but\nwhether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.\n    Agricultural aides to English said the congressman\'s first\nchoice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat\nfarmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid\nfor winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of\ncontroversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an\neven greater cutback in the bill, they said.\n    Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still\nreceive 92 pct of deficiency payments.\n    Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)\nhave both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to\ninclude a 0/92 program for feedgrains.\n    An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm\nbill, but to be fair to all crops.\n    Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would\nlikely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are\ngreater than to idle the land, economists said.\n    Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is\npremature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the\nHouse Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the\nimpacts of such a program.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES Higher oil prices and stronger than\nexpected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.\ninterest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive\nchart outlook, financial analysts said.\n    The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment\nduring February was above market expectations for a rise of\n170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond\nfutures that drove the June contract through key technical\nsupport at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.\n    \"I don\'t like that fact that we had a close below 101,\"\nsaid Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level\nin the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month\ntrading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday\nled to bullish forecasts by chartists.\n    But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly\ncharts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.\n    Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32\nmay signal a bearish double top formation portending steep\nlosses.\n    \"I tend to go along with the double top scenario,\" said\nNorthern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.\n    Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact\nthat the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has\noccurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.\n    Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner\nremains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find\nsupport between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.\n    The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner\'s expectation\nthat the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on\nan improving inflation outlook.\n    With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal\nReserve little room to ease monetary policy, \"the inflation\noutlook is improving,\" Leiner said, and that should lead to\nrelatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar\nprices.\n    Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices\nremains a concern for the inflation outlook.\n    Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were\nmaintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an\nextra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from\nEcuador after an earthquake Thursday.\n    \"The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,\"\nsaid Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.\n    The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely\n\"media induced,\" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC\nproduction may be within quotas, \"oil stocks are at\ntremendously high levels.\"\n    Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil\nprices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he\nsaid, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

AFRICAN IMPORTS The Treasury proposed allowing \ntemporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium\noxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending\nclarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last\nfall.\n    The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next\nweek requests written congressional and public comment within\n60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported\nfor U.S. processing and exporting to third countries.\n    The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary\nimports because it felt Congress had not intended when it\npassed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall\n-- overriding President Reagan\'s veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.\n    \"The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal\ngovernment\'s enrichment industry could be seriously injured in\na manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on\nuranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for\nprocessing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the\nact,\" the Treasury brief said.\n    The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and\noxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their\nSouth African origin ore and oxide to other countries including\nthe Soviet Union for processing.\n    Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African\nore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export\n\"provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a\nlicense for importation issued by the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission.\"\n    The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods\nto be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled\norganizations for repair or servicing in the United States.\n    \"The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be made\nunder bond,\" the brief said.\n    The South African sanctions law, enacted by the United\nStates to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation\npracticed by South Africa\'s white minority government,\nprohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel,\ncoal and textiles at the end of 1986.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
